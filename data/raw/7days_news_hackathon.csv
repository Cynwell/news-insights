Technology,Reuters,"July 15, 2024",British regulators to examine Big Tech's digital wallets,"LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - British regulators said on Monday they were looking into the soaring use of digital wallets offered by Big Tech firms, including whether there are any competition, consumer protection or market integrity concerns.
The Financial Conduct Authority and Payments Systems Regulator is seeking views on the benefits and risks, and will assess the impact digital wallets, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal, have on competition and choice of payment options at checkout, among other things.

Digital wallets are now likely used by more than half of UK adults and have become ""an increasingly important touchpoint"" between Big Tech companies and UK consumers, they said in a statement.
""Digital wallets are steadily becoming a go-to payment type and while this presents exciting opportunities, there might be risks too,"" said David Geale, the PSR's managing director.
Nikhil Rathi, the FCA's chief executive, said the growth of digital wallets represented a ""seismic shift"" in how people pay and regulators wanted to maximise the opportunities while ""protecting against any risks this technology may present.""

Regulators and lawmakers in Europe and the United States have been examining the growing role of Big Tech in financial services.
The U.S. consumer watchdog last year proposed regulating payments and smartphone wallets, prompting criticism from the industry.
The British regulators said their review of digital wallets built on their previous work on contactless mobile payments and on the role of Big Tech firms in financial services.
After considering all feedback, the regulators provide an update on Big Tech and digital wallets by the first quarter of 2025.

Technology,CNN,"July 15, 2024",Google is close to making its biggest acquisition ever,"New York CNN — Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant’s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN’s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google’s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company’s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a “shot across the bow” at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a “major bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,” Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers’ call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an “illegal download” on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission “much weaker” and sparking an “accelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.” If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders — Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html,/,
Technology,CNN,"July 15, 2024",Secret Service faces serious questions about security footprint and rooftop access at Trump event,"In the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, there are widespread concerns and questions about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president’s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the “three o’clock” position of Trump’s podium location, with shots coming from his right side. Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect who was found on top of a roof. Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is helped off the stage at a campaign event in Butler, Pa., Saturday, July 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) RELATED ARTICLE What was said on stage in the seconds after Trump was shot Notably, the shooter’s location was outside the security perimeter, raising questions about both the size of the perimeter and efforts to sweep and secure the American Glass Research building, and how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access. President Joe Biden said Sunday he has directed US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle “to review all security measures – all security measures – for the Republican National Convention.” “I’ve directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday’s rally to assess exactly what happened. And I’ll share the results of that independent review with the American people,” Biden said. Law enforcement sources say that part of the aftermath will include a review of whether the Secret Service had enough assets to protect Trump days ahead of officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee and whether procedures were followed to conduct security sweeps of the building that offered a vantage point for the alleged shooter. “Foundationally, one of the most basic elements of site security, especially a site that’s outside and largely uncontrolled, is (to) eliminate sight lines to this space where the protectee will be either speaking or just occupying,” former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday morning. “When you look at that map, it so clearly points to those buildings that are within it, clearly within shooting range.” FBI now leading the investigation into attempted assassination It is not yet clear how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access in relatively close proximity, or why that building was left outside the “hard” security perimeter. The FBI is now the lead agency investigating the attempted assassination. But the security lapse issue will be for the Department of Homeland Security and USSS, as well as Congress, to look into. According to CNN affiliate KDKA, a witness says he told officers that he saw a gunman moving “from roof to roof,” moments before the assassination attempt. Ben Macer was along a fence line when he saw “the guy move from roof to roof. (I) told an officer (the alleged shooter) was on the roof,” KDKA reported. “When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that.” Witnesses have also told reporters that they saw a person fitting the description of the alleged shooter carrying a rifle outside the security cordon of the rally before the shooting. Corey Comperatore, who was killed after a gunman targeted former president Donald Trump at a rally on Saturday. RELATED ARTICLE Man killed in Trump assassination attempt identified as firefighter Corey Comperatore The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might’ve been acting suspiciously near the event magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him – and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. Multiple law enforcement sources told CNN that the shooter had explosive material in his car and residence. The Secret Service does not allow any weapons inside the cordoned off areas of any event. AGR has not responded to questions from CNN about the incident or security. Authorities have identified the gunman involved in the attack as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. Multiple law enforcement sources with in-depth knowledge of Secret Service operations have told CNN counter-sniper teams have wide discretion when shooting down a threat. The Secret Service says there were four counter-sniper teams – two from USSS and two from local law enforcement. The agency says that, at the time of the shooting, Cheatle was in Milwaukee, where this week’s Republican National Convention is being held. Cheatle, according to The New York Times, sent a memo on Sunday, praising the agents who were with Trump at the rally Saturday for moving quickly and neutralizing the threat. “The attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, is a moment that forever will be remembered in history,” she wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by the Times. CNN has reached out to the Secret Service about the reported memo. Calls from Congress for probes into security ‘failure’ Republican and Democratic lawmakers are already demanding answers from the agency on the security posture and hearings on the incident. House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed a “full investigation” of the shooting, featuring testimony from USSS, DHS and the FBI, and two Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee have also called for an investigation. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, on CNN’s “State of the Union,” likewise said that Congress had “oversight scrutiny and responsibility,” and said there was a “failure of the overall broader net.” House Speaker Johnson calls out vilification of Trump after assassination attempt 00:56 - Source: CNN House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green held a call with Cheatle Sunday afternoon, pressing her on what led to Saturday’s security failures, a committee source familiar with the call told CNN. Cheatle committed to providing requested documents to the committee promptly, as able, per the source. Green also detailed the information requests he has with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which include USSS communications and documents surrounding the rally, the source added. The Tennessee Republican sent a letter to Mayorkas earlier Sunday requesting documents about Secret Service security plans and its communications by July 19 and a briefing by July 22. House Oversight Chairman James Comer contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is calling on Cheatle to appear for a hearing on July 22. New York Reps. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, and Mike Lawler, a Republican, are also working to introduce a bill they say would give enhanced USSS protection to Trump, Biden and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “As reports continue to emerge, it’s clear that more protection is needed for all major candidates for president,” the pair said in a joint statement provided to CNN. In a separate scathing letter to the Secret Service director on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said that there was a “security failure at the highest level, not seen since the attempted assassination of President Reagan.” “This cannot happen, and I demand accountability,” Gallego, who is running for an Arizona Senate seat, said. Secret Service denies claims that it rejected requests for more security for Trump The Secret Service – along with local law enforcement in Pennsylvania who assisted in securing the rally venue, as well as sources close to Trump’s campaign – is denying rumors circulating on social media, including by a Republican member of Congress, that the agency had denied requests from Trump’s team for more security. In a statement, the Secret Service said the detail had been increased recently. “There’s an untrue assertion that a member of the former President’s team requested additional security resources and that those were rebuffed,” said Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.” The FBI also pushed back on the implication on Saturday night. tappertrump.jpg VIDEO RELATED VIDEO Jake Tapper: ‘We are living in an era of political violence’ “There was no additional request for security that was ever denied by the FBI,” Kevin Rojek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office said during a news conference. The incident also raises questions about security at the upcoming Republican convention. Recently, the questions over how the Secret Service and law enforcement would treat those carrying firearms was raised at a press conference explaining the RNC security plan. A local official, Nick DeSiato, made clear due to Wisconsin law, firearms would be allowed in the “soft” perimeter – an area outside the magnetometers that is limited to foot traffic. Shooting comes after other lapses in protection for high-profile officials The scrutiny comes as the Secret Service has dealt with security lapses in recent months and years. In May 2023, an intruder gained access to the home of Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, despite his round-the-clock Secret Service protection. Sullivan encountered the intruder in his home and alerted his security detail. Sullivan was unharmed. On January 6, 2021, then-incoming Vice President Kamala Harris was driven by her security detail yards away from a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Headquarters. She was evacuated after law enforcement discovered the pipe bomb which was more than 90 minutes after her arrival. The Secret Service uses intelligence and strategic information to determine security posture. The agency is not formally part of the intelligence community, and is considered a “consumer” of intelligence, relying heavily on relationships with agencies such as the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

Technology,CNN,"July 17, 2024",Nasdaq has worst day since 2022 as tech stocks get slammed,"Tech shares slumped Wednesday as investors shed the behemoths that fueled Wall Street’s monster stock rally this year.

The Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 2.8%, logging its worst day since December 2022. The S&P 500 lost 1.4%.

The Dow rose 0.6%, closing at another record high and above 41,000 for the first time. That comes exactly two months after the Dow first closed above the 40,000 level.

Shares of tech heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.6% and rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares dropped by 10.2%.

The selloff comes after a Tuesday report from Bloomberg that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.

The US Commerce Department declined to comment.

Investors are also selling tech stocks after a cool inflation report last week and stronger-than-expected retail sales data on Tuesday pushed up bets for a rate cut in September. Wall Street is looking to beaten-down stocks that tend to perform better when borrowing costs are low.

The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell in midday trading Wednesday but is still up 4.5% for the week.

The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have led most of the gains this year thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, tumbled. Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell 1.3%, Apple (AAPL) shares slid 2.5%, Amazon (AMZN) shares declined 2.6%, Alphabet shares declined 1.6%, Tesla shares slipped 3.1% and Meta Platforms shares lost 5.7%.

As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.

The Dow ended the day lower by 533 points, or 1.3%, retreating from a record high reached a day ago. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7%, extending its losses after logging its worst day since 2022 on Wednesday.

“A correction was overdue and no one will be surprised if the market regains its momentum by the end of earnings season,” wrote Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates, in a Thursday note.

Investors have this week moved out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that powered the market to repeated record highs this year. The shift comes after cooling inflation data and stronger-than-expected retail sales data bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting sky-high interest rates as soon as September.

Shares of smaller companies that tend to do well in a lower-rate environment began rallying last week, helping the Dow reach fresh highs. But small-cap stocks have pared back their gains in recent sessions: The Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of US small caps, fell 1.8% on Thursday.

Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are on pace to close the week lower, while Tesla is on track to end slightly higher.

Tech stocks also took a hit this week after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.

Ultra-low cost airline SunCountry, Allegiant Air, Frontier and Spirit Airlines were experiencing disruptions caused by the outage on Friday. Southwest Airlines and JetBlue were not impacted by the outage. “While our operational systems were not impacted by this outage, customers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies,” JetBlue said in a statement. Toronto-based Porter Airlines announced that it was canceling flights on Friday until noon ET due to “prolonged third-party technology systems outages affecting multiple global industries. Two low-cost airlines in Mexico City, Volaris and Viva Aerobus, were also impacted. Passengers traveling through Los Angeles International Airport are experiencing a “mixed bag” of delays and cancellations due to the tech outage, an airport spokesperson told CNN. At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport airside operations are working, although some customer-facing airlines “are dealing with a few challenges,” amid the ongoing global computer outage, Andrew Gobeil, who oversees public affairs outreach at the airport, told CNN. At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport officials “anticipate significant delays and cancellations throughout the day,” the airport said. “We ask customers to verify your flight status with your airline prior to heading to the airport. Longer lines are possible so allow extra time.” Chicago O’Hare International Airport advised passengers to check their flight status directly with their carrier due to the tech issues. “Longer lines and wait times are possible, please allow extra time,” it said. John F. Kennedy International Airport said: “The Port Authority is not affected by the ongoing global network outage, but some airlines are experiencing delays/cancellations. DO NOT head to the airport unless your flight status is confirmed,” according to an airport post on X. That guidance applies to LaGuardia and Newark airports as well. Philadelphia International Airport said passengers should expect delays and cancellations on Friday. Charlotte Douglas International Airport advised passengers not to come to the airport “unless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.” Miami International Airport advised that US Customs and Border Patrol operations are being affected nationwide, “so international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.” Passengers and airline pilots wait at Newark International Airport after United Airlines and other airlines grounded flights because of a worldwide tech outage.

","BEIJING, July 15 (Reuters) - China's new home prices in June fell at the fastest clip in nine years while property sales and investment slumped, increasing pressure on policymakers for more stimulus to prop up the battered sector as it struggles to find a bottom. New home prices slid 4.5% from a year earlier, hitting the lowest since June 2015, deeper than a 3.9% slide in May, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Prices were down 0.7% month-on-month in June after a 0.7% dip in May. Since 2021, the property market's steep downturn has led to a series of developers defaulting, leaving numerous construction sites idle. This has eroded confidence in the sector, traditionally favoured by Chinese households as a safe haven for their savings. The property sector which at its peak accounted for a quarter of GDP, remains a major drag on the $18 trillion economy. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Authorities have rolled out a flurry of support measures, including cutting home buying costs in major cities and allowing local governments to buy some unsold apartments and turn them into affordable housing. ""Recent supports are a step in the right direction but are still dwarfed by the scale of the problem. Real estate's tentacles run deep. When the sector hurts, pain is felt economy-wide,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise, economist at Moody's Analytics, in a research note. Official data also showed China's economy grew 4.7% in April-June, its slowest since the first quarter of 2023 and missing a 5.1% analysts' forecast in a Reuters poll. Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics While some measures such as lifting of home purchase restrictions have helped market sentiment, more stimulus may not bolster falling prices. ""The structure of supply and demand in the property sector has been fundamentally reversed. (The market) does not need to have excessively high expectations of the effects of the policies,"" said Zhang Dawei, analyst at Centaline Property Agency Ltd. ""It is unlikely that there will be a rise across the board in the sector in the future,"" Zhang said.

Policy advisers believe China could unveil tax and fiscal changes that would funnel more tax revenues to debt-laden local governments to help ease pressure on their finances.

China property,Bloomberg,"July 15, 2024",China Home Prices Fall Sharply Despite Latest Rescue Plan,"China’s home prices fell again in June, underscoring the challenge for policymakers to halt the property market slump that’s hurting developers and the economy.
New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, dropped 0.67% from May, when they slid 0.71%, the most since October 2014, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Monday. Values of existing homes declined 0.85%, compared with a 1% decrease a month earlier.
The figures add to evidence that a rescue package unveiled in May has done little to boost sentiment in the real estate market. Yet few expect more aggressive measures to emerge from a key five-year meeting of Chinese Communist Party officials starting Monday. Pressure on prices is likely to remain as developers and homeowners resort to deep discounts to offload homes.
“Fears of catching a falling knife could deter property investment,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kristy Hung and Monica Si wrote in a recent note. “Excessive inventory of new and existing homes added pressure for further price drops.”
China in May introduced a broad real estate policy package centered on relaxing mortgage rules and encouraging local governments to buy unsold homes. All four of the nation’s biggest cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou — have since rolled out major easing measures for homebuyers.
Investors and analysts are skeptical that the steps will be sufficient due to the limited central bank funding revealed so far and the slow progress of existing trial programs in several cities.

Property polices are a key area of focus during the Third Plenum this week, one of the most important political meetings of the Chinese Communist Party. China has the firepower to end its housing crisis, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve, but it’s unlikely to pull the trigger, according to Bloomberg Economics.
For now, investors are yet to be convinced that the housing slump has reached a turning point. Shares of Chinese real estate firms have slid further into a bear market, dropping 26% from a mid-May high.
Developer China Vanke Co. last week warned of a loss of as much as 9 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in the first half, as discounts and high land acquisition costs hurt margins. The state-backed company is trying to avoid following the likes of China Evergrande Group and Country Garden Holdings Co. into default.

China property,房天下,"July 15, 2024",天津房价再度下跌，二手房存量猛增,"天津楼市再次出现房价下跌现象，新房与二手房价格环比均有小幅下降。同时，二手房存量从139,000套增加至196,000套，市场供需失衡。专家认为，天津房价短期内难有大幅反弹。


近几个月，天津的房地产市场确实表现出一定的疲软迹象。新房和二手房价格的双双下跌，虽然幅度不大，但反映了市场上的供需失衡状态。特别是二手房的存量，从之前的139,000套增加到现在的196,000套，显示出市场上的供过于求。这种情况给想要通过房价反弹来获利的投资者带来了挑战。

近年来，天津房价经历了长时间的下跌，从2017年开始的横盘，到2018年开始的下行，整体市场已经经历了多年的调整。这种长期的价格下跌，使得部分地区的房价比高峰时期下降了约30%。尽管当前的价格跌幅不大，但也反映了市场的相对稳定性。然而，这也意味着要实现显著的价格反弹并不容易。

对于普通购房者来说，当前的市场环境可能更适合刚需购房。价格相对稳定，选择的房源也较为丰富。但对于投资者来说，需要更加谨慎，短期内通过房价上涨获利的可能性较低。

总的来说，天津房地产市场的未来走势仍然需要关注政策调控、经济环境以及供需平衡等多方面因素。对于购房者和投资者来说，理性判断和谨慎决策是目前最为重要的。",https://tj.news.fang.com/open/50645167.html,/,

China property,thepaper.cn,"July 19, 2024",多家上市房企高管增持股票提振信心：万科一天内打光2亿元“子弹”,"为提振股价、增强投资人信心，多家上市房企发布增持计划，宣布公司高管或大股东增持股票。

近半个月以来，包括万科、华夏幸福、新湖中宝、北辰实业等企业纷纷发布股票增持计划，增持金额从千万元至上亿元。

其中，地产龙头万科企业股份有限公司（万科A，000002.SZ）高管自筹2亿元增持公司股票且增持股份自愿锁定两年。万科于7月15日发布的公告显示，基于对行业和公司未来发展的长期信心，万科骨干管理人员自筹资金2亿元，自2024年7月10日起6个月内，在符合相关法律法规要求的前提下，委托第三方通过信托计划自愿增持公司A股股份，截至2024年7月15日，本次增持计划已实施完毕。

万科表示，为增强市场信心，此次公司管理团队及骨干人员共同参与，在能力范围内进行最大力度增持，以表达对公司前景的充分信心及同舟共济的坚定决心。

公司高管一同参与增持股票的还有华夏幸福。7月10日，华夏幸福基业股份有限公司（华夏幸福，600340.SH）公告其董事长、实际控制人王文学及部分董事、高级管理人员累计增持1596万元公司股份，计划实施完毕。

同时，基于对公司战略发展的坚定信心及对公司未来发展前景的充分认可，同时为进一步促进公司持续、稳定、健康发展，切实维护公司及全体股东利益，华夏幸福董事长、实控人王文学将进行2024年第二轮增持：自2024年7月11日起6个月内，继续增持1000万-1200万元。

诸葛数据研究中心高级分析师关荣雪认为，今年上半年，整个房地产行业仍然面临调整压力，大部分房企销售经营业绩表现不佳，当前又处于业绩公告的频发期，因此，万科、华夏幸福等上市房企纷纷宣布高管增持股票，重点聚焦“增信心”。

中指研究院企业研究总监刘水也认为，部分房企增持行为有利于增强核心员工与股东利益的一致性，表达管理层对公司、行业发展的长期看好，从而增强投资人信心，向外界传递企业基本面稳健的信心。

除了号召公司高管增持股票提振市场信心外，也有公司大股东拿出真金白银增持股票。

北辰实业（601588.SH）于7月10日发布的公告亦显示，公司控股股东北辰集团决定自本公告披露之日起6个月内增持公司A股股份，累计增持金额不低于3500万元，不超过7000万元，增持比例不超过公司总股本的2%。本次拟增持的股份不设固定价格、价格区间。

此外，新湖中宝（600208.SH）于7月15日发布公告，基于对公司未来发展前景的信心以及公司价值的认可，公司第一大股东衢州智宝拟通过自有资金，自2024年7月16日起6个月内，通过上交所交易系统集中竞价方式增持上市公司股份，增持金额不低于5000万元，不超过10000万元，增持价格不高于2元/股公司。这距离衢州智宝上一次发布增持公告仅不到20天。

截至7月18日收盘，新湖中宝报1.65元/股；北辰实业报1.34元/股。

关荣雪提到，股东增持和回购有助于提振股价、增强投资人信心，向外界传递企业基本面稳健的信息。此外，除了起到增强企业信心的助力外，也能够展现出房地产企业面对市场下行应有的担当与缓解压力的谋略，或将在市场上形成积极且正面的导向作用。

不过，刘水也提到，房地产板块股价表现仍然取决于行业复苏的进展。2024年上半年，居民收入预期和市场信心偏弱、房价下跌预期仍在等因素继续制约着置业需求释放，高基数下新建商品房销售面积同比下降19%，市场调整幅度仍较大，房地产板块表现持续低迷，短期内投资人仍充满忧虑。因此，房地产板块整体表现仍有待于市场筑底复苏。另一方面，房企股价也受自身现金流安全、资产负债优化、销售经营业绩等个股基本面影响。特别是对于出险房企，能够推出改善公司资产质量、完成债务重组、尽快恢复经营的方案才是保壳能够成功的关键。",https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_28112464,/,
China property,杭州网,"July 21, 2024",评估价1亿，起拍价直接打2折，杭州这套一线江景排屋要拍卖了,"杭州的拍卖房市场又上新了。

近日，阿里资产的拍卖平台上线了一套一线江景排屋，市场估值高达1亿。

image.png

房源是江河汇的中海御道二区（御道江河汇流公寓二区）4幢103室，产证面积为278.89平方米，共5层7厅6室，算下来单价36万元/平方米。

“排屋，又是一线江景，整个二区只有12套，稀缺度还是有的。”周边门店的房产中介告诉我们，周边这类房源在二手房市场挂牌的不太多，他们也在密切关注这套房子的成交情况，或许对板块内或者市中心同类产品有一定借鉴意义。

这套房源将在8月17日10时30分至8月18日10时30分（延时除外）进行线上拍卖。因为标的总价亮眼，截至记者发稿前，已有近6万人次围观。虽然市场价1个亿，但起拍价很“良心”，直接打了个2折，2088万元起。

这是个什么概念呢？

我们查询了杭州透明售房网的一房一价表，显示这套排屋当初的一手房（毛坯）备案价为86000.4元/平方米，总价2398.5万元。也就是说，起拍价比当初的一手房售价低了310.5万元，是个“破发价”，而市场评估价却比备案价涨了7601.5万元，几乎是翻了两番。

再来看这套房子本身，地上一层为超大客厅、餐厅和中西双厨；地上二层为套房、客房和起居室；地上三层为超大主卧套房，包括书房、衣帽间，以及带汗蒸房和浴缸的卫生间。

而且，这套排屋还有大量赠送面积，包括地下室和四楼面积，可以设置套房、书房，以及影音室和保姆房等，全部加起来，这套排屋的使用面积超过700平方米，空间还是很阔绰的。

为什么这套排屋能估出这么高的市场价？

除了它含着“金汤匙”出生的江河汇地段，还有很重要的一点，这是套精装排屋。根据阿里资产拍卖页面显示，光精装花费就有1300万元。

另外，该房源还带两个车位，不在起拍价内，需要与房子一起购买，车位价格是70万元/个。

值得一提的是，这是一次正常的商拍，即受业主委托而进行的正常拍卖，不是因破产等原因进行的司法拍卖。该房源无诉讼、无查封、无经营情况、无租赁、无共有情况。也就是说，买家们没有什么后顾之忧。房东于2018年1月买入该套房源，这套排屋已满五唯一，无个税，无增值税，又能为未来业主省下不少费用。

不过也正因为此，拍卖页面明确显示，成交后买家需另付软件服务费（成交价的0.5%-1%），以及佣金（成交价的0.5%）。倘若拿起拍价2088万元成交来算，至少要付20.88万元。倘若拍到1个亿，至少要付100万元！",https://hznews.hangzhou.com.cn/jingji/content/2024-07/21/content_8762028.htm,/,
China property,Sina,"July 22, 2024",江苏江阴：大力推广“旧房收购”，“卖旧买新”契税补贴单套最高10万元,"根据江阴发布7月22日消息，江苏省江阴市房地产调控领导小组办公室发布《关于进一步促进江阴市房地产市场平稳健康发展若干政策措施的通知》，包括优化土地出让政策，推广商品住房“以旧换新”活动，加大公积金支持购房力度，全面推行房票安置等8条措施，提振住房消费信心。

商品房“卖旧买新”契税最高补贴10万元

江阴积极推广商品住房“以旧换新”活动，同时实施契税补贴政策。《通知》明确，江阴提出大力推广“旧房收购”。支持房地产开发企业开展“直接收购”式“以旧换新”业务，提档升级国企收购模式，鼓励支持其他房企直接收购，为开发企业与购房者在“以旧换新”过程中的旧房收购和新房交易提供便捷服务。积极开展“联合帮卖”。鼓励房地产开发企业与房地产经纪机构合作，通过优先推售、集中帮卖模式，为购房者提供卖旧买新服务。

契税补贴方面，江阴明确在2023年1月1日至2024年12月31日期间，在本市范围内出售自有住房并于2024年5月1日至2024年12月31日期间，购买新建商品住房的家庭，给予“卖旧买新”契税补贴。单套补贴总额最高不超过10万元。

具体标准为：在2024年5月1日至2024年8月31日期间购买新建商品住房的，建筑面积在144平方米以下房源给予50%的契税补贴；建筑面积在144平方米（含）以上房源给予100%的契税补贴。在2024年9月1日至2024年12月31日期间购买新建商品住房的，建筑面积在144平方米以下房源给予40%的契税补贴；建筑面积在144平方米（含）以上房源给予80%的契税补贴。

房票可延期一年使用，加大房票购房补贴比例

江阴要求加大公积金支持购房力度，落实商业贷款利率支持政策。职工家庭借款人本人符合贷款条件的，最高贷款额度从50万元调整为80万元；借款人及配偶均符合贷款条件的，最高贷款额度从80万元调整为100万元。对生育二孩或三孩的本市户籍家庭，首次申请公积金贷款购买首套自住住房的，借款人本人符合贷款条件的，最高贷款额度从60万元提高到100万元；借款人及配偶均符合贷款条件的，最高贷款额度从100万元调整为130万元。委托还贷的保留余额调整为最近一个月的住房公积金（不含新职工住房补贴）月实缴额由原来的12倍调整为6倍。无锡市行政区域以外城市缴存住房公积金的职工，夫妻双方及其直系亲属（父母、子女）任意一方为无锡市（含江阴）户籍的，在无锡市（含江阴）购买自住住房时，可申请办理公积金异地个人住房贷款。

居民家庭存量住房贷款若满足当前首套房住房信贷条件的，可向承贷金融机构提出申请，协商变更合同约定的利率水平。调整后的贷款利率不低于原贷款发放时首套住房商业性个人住房贷款利率政策下限。

加大房票购房安置力度，允许延长使用期限，延长期不超过一年。增加房票金额基数，将装潢及附属物补偿纳入房票金额计算基数。加大补贴比例，在6个月内使用房票购房的，按购房使用房票金额原则上给予不低于17%的补贴；在7到12个月内使用房票购房的，原则上给予不低于16%的补贴；在延长期内使用房票购房的，原则上给予不低于15%的补贴。扩大房票使用人范围，将个人产权的非住宅房屋（不含工矿仓储房屋）的被征收人纳入房票使用人范围，畅通全市通用。

全面取消人才落户年龄限制和社保缴纳要求

江阴提出筹集一批青年驿站，对来我市求职面试的高校应届毕业生提供最长90天的免费住宿服务。对符合条件的新引进的青年人才，分别给予每年最高本科1万元、硕士研究生1.5万元、博士研究生2.4万元的租房补贴，累计支持最长两年；对符合条件的优秀青年人才给予本科最高1万元、硕士研究生2万元、博士研究生3万元的生活补贴。全面推进高层次人才分类认定，对符合条件的人才给予20万元-500万元的购房补贴。持续开展“人才房优惠购”活动，积极推进人才公寓、国际人才社区建设。全面取消各类人才落户年龄限制和社保缴纳要求，鼓励亲属随迁落户。

此外，江阴支持采用带规划设计方案、“出让合同+投资发展监管协议”模式挂牌，合理确定开竣工时间，原则上开工时间最长可不超过约定交地时间一年，开发建设周期可最长不超过36个月。支持土地使用权人通过合作开发、转让等方式盘活存量住宅用地。对未建设的房地产开发项目，鼓励土地使用权人与优质房地产企业、有实力的投资方合作开发，共同成立项目公司的，可与出让方签订补充合同，以项目公司作为土地使用权人办理项目开发建设手续。根据市场需求优化住宅用地的规模、布局和结构，完善对应商品住宅去化周期，以人定房，以房定地，统筹“市场+保障”、“货币+房票”的住宅用地供应安排。

支持从总平布局、单体设计、公共配套、界面风貌等多方面优化高品质住区规划设计要求；分级分类优化户外公共配套设施的计容规则，灵活确定户内阳台空间的面积比例，有效提高住宅户内实际使用空间；鼓励“景观生态”住宅建设试点。

对房地产开发企业按照高品质住区规划建设要求调整规划方案的，给予政策支持。除依法应予无偿收回的闲置土地外，因规划调整或调整建设高品质住区导致土地无法按照供地时的规划条件继续开发利用的，收回或收购处置方案报经供地原批准机关同意后，支持通过协商采用有条件收回、收购的方式盘活存量住宅用地，并按照高品质住区规划建设要求明确新的规划条件后重新供应。

根据上级动态建立的项目白名单，搭建政银企沟通平台，对符合融资条件的房地产项目应进尽进，全力支持满足房地产企业合理融资需求。",https://finance.sina.cn/2024-07-24/detail-incfezfz7056769.d.html?oid=%E7%83%9F%E5%8F%B0%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%A5%B3%E8%81%94%E7%B3%BB%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1{%E7%BD%91%E5%9D%80wpa32.com}%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%AE%89%E6%8E%92%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%BE%BE-%E7%83%9F%E5%8F%B0%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%A5%B3%E8%81%94%E7%B3%BB%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1{%E7%BD%91%E5%9D%80wpa32.com}%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%AE%89%E6%8E%92%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%BE%BE-%E7%83%9F%E5%8F%B0%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%A5%B3%E8%81%94%E7%B3%BB%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1{%E7%BD%91%E5%9D%80wpa32.com}%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%B4%E5%AE%89%E6%8E%92%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%88%B0%E8%BE%BE.iol&vt=4&cid=76524&node_id=76524,/,
