"Of Ashley, Asos, and unconventional sources",ASOS PLC,"FT Alphaville recommends A Corner Office, an old fashioned insider-y blog of City war stories, written anonymously. On Monday it had an intriguing post about eavesdropping. Here’s an extract:
I sat outside an out-of-the-way coffee shop in the sunshine last week half an hour early for a catch-up with an old mate. Old coat &amp; jeans, full-on scruff these days now I’m not on the Buy side.
Two smartly dressed men of similar age sat next to me and launched into conversation, which sadly I only got half of because the softly spoken one was facing away from me.
Maybe they thought I was a tramp, but they were full of detail.
“So it’ll be 100% premium on the equity, making that £700m-ish…….we’ve got loads of cash to deploy so need to crack on as soon as the results are out…….we don’t want to work with XXXX because I hate them, and you’re the expert anyway…….I’ve got a raft of investors saying show me your next deal….Mike can do the lot, but we don’t want him to…..we’ll speak to ZZZZ*”
(We’ve confirmed that the blog author is a real person who knows the territory and has no obvious reason to be making stuff up. We take the protection of anonymity very seriously so your choice here is either to believe us or not.)
FTAV also recommends Betaville, an M&amp;A gossip blog whose exclusivity is protected by a very high paywall. On Friday it ran an “uncooked” alert about the fashion retailer Asos regarding market speculation about stakebuilding and takeover interest. Here’s an extract:
People following the situation have heard rumours ASOS has attracted takeover interest from an international predator.
Some people following the situation have heard a company based in Turkey with a multibillion dollar valuation is the suitor stalking ASOS.
One person following the situation had heard the Turkish company has been holding talks with Bestseller, one of ASOS’s largest shareholders with around a 26pc shareholding, about making a joint offer for ASOS and made last year about a deal.
Rumour accuracy is undetermined but the timing wasn’t ideal. Asos shares this week hit their lowest since 2010 as brokers queued up to predict a cash call. Interim results the week before had laid bare the Topshop and Miss Selfridge owner’s problems with online fatigue, competition, overstocking, cost inflation and unprofitable overexpansion.
Asos now needs to rush through cost cuts without further damaging sales or going overdrawn on its recently extended credit line. There’s zero margin for error and little confidence left in management. Asos short interest (per IHS Markit) accounts for 22 per cent of the free float with very little borrow available:
But a UK retailer in distress is Mike Ashley’s bat signal. Here he is, diving into the market on Monday and raising Frasers’ stake in Asos to 7.4 per cent from 5.1 per cent.
Frasers (née Sports Direct) is Asos’s third-biggest shareholder. The biggest is Bestseller, the Danish retailer wholly owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, Scotland’s richest man, who’ll be banking another £90mn when the Numis sale to Deutsche Bank completes.
Ashley stepped down last year as a Frasers director but retains a controlling stake, in addition to a big pile of money he gained from the 2021 sale of Newcastle United to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.
There’s also some history with Topshop and its previous owner Philip Green.
Asos said it doesn’t comment on the shareholdings of individual investors, and has a policy of not commenting on rumour or speculation. At pixel Asos had a market value of £431mn, or over half of £700mn-ish.

MSCI drops two Adani Group stocks from India benchmark,Adani Group,"Global index provider MSCI has dropped two Adani Group stocks from its India equities benchmark, in a move analysts said could spur investor outflows of almost $400mn and complicate plans for share sales by the sprawling Indian conglomerate.
The latest setback for the industrial group owned by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani follows months of grappling with accusations of fraud and stock price manipulation made by short seller Hindenburg Research, which at one point lopped off more than $150bn from the market value of Adani’s listed companies.
The allegations, which Adani denies, also spurred greater scrutiny from index providers over how much of the companies were freely traded. MSCI said in a statement on Friday that it would drop Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission from its India Domestic index at the end of the month.
The deletion of the two listed companies from the MSCI index adds to the challenges facing Adani Group, which has struggled to shore up investor confidence following the short seller’s report and has been forced to slow the previously breakneck pace of its acquisitions and spending.
“The company has done very little, if anything at all, to provide a different narrative and show things are not how Hindenburg said,” said Brian Freitas, an independent analyst. Adani did publish a 413-page rebuttal to Hindenburg’s allegations in late January.
Freitas said the exclusions, which MSCI blamed on the companies’ failure to meet its minimum free-float requirements, would trigger outflows of almost $400mn, as investors who track the benchmark reduce their shareholdings.
The deletion of the two Adani Group stocks follows a cut to their index weightings, along with those of several other Adani listings, by MSCI in February.
Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission together account for about 0.6 per cent of MSCI’s India Domestic index, which tracks 115 of the largest and most liquid stocks traded in the country with a combined market capitalisation of $1.08tn. Six other Adani Group stocks will remain in the index, with a total combined weighting of about 1.8 per cent of the stock benchmark after the cuts.
The MSCI announcement also comes after three Adani companies, including Adani Transmission, told stock exchanges that they were considering new share sales, without giving details. Their boards will meet to decide on Saturday.
Last week, Adani Enterprises, which includes the group’s coal trading and airports businesses, reported post-tax profits had more than doubled in the first quarter. It is one of the Adani companies considering fundraising.
“Given that Adani Transmission could also be looking to do a fundraise soon, this makes that more difficult because people are now going to be selling $200mn [of that stock] towards the end of this month,” Freitas said."
Are private markets a route to higher returns?,Adventurous Investor,"The latest bout of turmoil in global markets has sent fund managers scurrying to reassess their risks, not least in US banking shares.
But one strategy seems likely to survive the stock take, just as it has the ups and downs of the past three years: the drive to private markets.
If you believe the hype surrounding private assets, the old model of managing your money via a long-only fund run by a stock picking manager is “out” and everything private is in.
That means a broad spectrum from private equity and venture capital to private debt, where the underlying investment (or borrower) is a private business that is not listed on a stock market.
The attraction? Well, you might suspect that higher fees help attract fund managers, as do lower levels of reporting (the pesky companies don’t need to keep filing quarterly reports). There’s also the longer time periods for investing, a more patient approach and, of course, higher leverage.
The cynic might say you, as a private investor, should stay away from this: you’ll find yourself locked into more illiquid structures, with those higher fees. I certainly think anyone with less than £100,000 is best advised to stick to plainer fare such as tracker funds. But I would add that an adventurous investor with a few hundred thousand pounds could dabble in this area with, say, 10 to 15 per cent of their portfolio.
The evidence, though not entirely conclusive, suggests that many private asset classes such as private equity (PE) have in the past decade or so returned much more than assets from public markets (equities and bonds). PE has outperformed mainstream equity benchmarks since the financial crisis of 2008.
That said, it is worth noting that the correlation between PE as an asset class and major equity benchmarks over the past decade was around 0.7, which implies a very real relationship between volatile stock markets and private equity, though not identical returns.
Whether this will be the same in the next two decades, especially as interest rates increase, is anyone’s guess, but it makes sense for investors to consider how they might access private assets. Big institutional investors are now routinely allocating more than 30 per cent of their portfolios to private assets, though I think that sounds far too high for most risk-averse private investors.
The good news is that there are more easy-to-access fund vehicles to get into various niches within the private asset’s spectrum. The most established is private equity; within that space the biggest component comprises buyouts of large businesses. Asset managers such as Blackstone, Carlyle and Apollo dominate in this space but London-listed 3i is a well-respected player with a great record — its share price has gone up sixfold in the past decade.
I’d also highlight the two established fund-of-fund private equity listed players, Pantheon International and HarbourVest. Both have LSE-listed funds that give you access to a huge range of underlying funds, with big chunky discounts — in both cases of over 40 per cent — to their net asset value. My own sense is that we’re probably a lot closer to the bottom of the valuation cycle for buyout private equity as an asset class. It’s still possible, of course, that valuations fall even further if we hit a nasty recession.
I’d also note hybrid outfits such as Melrose, in effect a buyout operator that snaps up key industrial firms then transforms them like a PE house with the aim of spinning them off — as it has just done with Dowlais, the old GKN automotives components business. At a push I’d also highlight Halma, another acquisitive listed industrial that likes to buy in the right company and then overlay its own corporate approach — as does Danaher in the US, whose share price has more than doubled over five years.
But private equity is much more than just large buyout firms. A range of specialists target slightly smaller (though still large-cap) businesses, but with a focus on operational transformation and using technology to scale up the underlying business. In this space the standout success on the UK stock market is Hg Capital, alongside Oakley Capital Investments, both of which have a focus on technology-enabled growth businesses. Oakley in particular has a quality portfolio, but its shares trade at a big discount.
Even these niche players tend to work with larger businesses. If you want to target your firepower on smaller-cap businesses — worth anything from £1mn to £50mn — your best bet is a newbie fund called Literacy Capital which listed a few years ago on the London market and boasts a very focused UK strategy.
Beyond “traditional” PE, we move into venture capital, which covers late-stage pre-IPO businesses — the focus of London-listed Chrysalis Investments’ approach as well as Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust’s large private portfolio — through to seed investing in very early stage start-ups. In terms of market cycles, I still think this is some way from the bottom of the valuation cycle, albeit getting closer by the month. Be aware, though, that the listed VC space is hugely volatile and should only ever sit in the most risky bit of your portfolio.
UK investors typically access this space via one of two routes. The most popular is VC trusts with their generous tax incentives, where the leading players are businesses such as Octopus and Baronsmead. The tax incentives are offered because this is a highly risky space with lots of potential downside. The other alternative is using a crowdfunding platform such as Seedrs and Crowdcube, where the emphasis is on really early-stage businesses. Again, the risk is very high — out of my portfolio of more than 20 small stakes at least four businesses have gone bust in just a few years.
I still own shares in businesses on both platforms but I’d argue that scale begets access to the quality deals. Just as the large buyout shops have the firepower and headcount to run big deals, large-scale VC firms have the infrastructure to build well researched, diversified portfolios of fast growth companies. In that category, the UK market offers Molten Ventures, a UK listed group.
Large-scale VC firms have the infrastructure to build well- researched, diversified portfolios of fast-growth companies
There are also direct, web-based platforms such as Moonfare. This innovative online platform allows you to invest directly into well established PE as well as earlier-stage VC funds, on terms that are usually only available to large institutional investors.
Private debt and private credit is another fast growing bit of the private assets spectrum. Intermediate Capital Group is a major player in this space. There are also specialist private lenders, who will lend directly to a smaller business via a debt package. The most established player on the London market is Pollen Street Capital, a London-listed asset manager that runs private equity money but also invests via tech-enabled lending businesses to everything from SMEs through to ordinary private customers.
What’s my strategy for incorporating this broad category of private assets in my portfolio? I like VC investments to be about 10 per cent of my total portfolio exposure. I also like traditional PE to be around the same level, usually through a listed fund-of-fund private equity offering or directly through Oakley and Hg Capital in my case.
I’ve taken the view that there is money to be made in the buyout approach, especially involving more mature industrial businesses — but I’d rather run that through London-listed businesses such as Melrose, Halma and Danaher.

Company bosses need to show bonus restraint,Advice & Comment,"Investment managers want the companies in which they invest to do well — and deliver sustainable returns over the years ahead.
That means a key role for the managers, who oversee the savings of 75 per cent of UK households, is to engage with the company executives and boards on their strategy, and to ensure their impact — on their employees, communities and the environment — is positive.
Investment managers want to see companies treat their employees fairly, have boards and senior leadership which reflect the diversity of their customers, and that are planning for the future.
Where companies are not following this long-term approach, the manager will engage with them through the year and may even vote against the company’s plans at their annual general meeting to show their concern.
Crucially, shareholders have the opportunity to vote on a company pay policy. That’s why every year the Investment Association sets out its principles of remuneration — essentially, the best practice investors expect to see when it comes to executive pay and bonuses.
This year, our principles build on our approach from the past few years, focusing on: continued restraint in light of the pandemic and how best to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics into pay structures.
While Covid-19 appears to be easing, no one underestimates its continuing impact. Many companies have struggled during the pandemic, but others have seen a business bonanza because the services they offered have been in greater demand.
We have been pleased to see that business leaders have shown pay restraint throughout this time. These companies have balanced the need to incentivise senior leadership, while at the same time being mindful of the experiences of their staff, customers, suppliers and wider community.
We recognise that companies need to compensate their executive teams properly to attract and keep the best talent.
But companies that furloughed staff should not now seek high levels of executive pay.
At the start of the pandemic we called on companies to ensure that executive pay reflected the approach to pay and conditions for the wider workforce.
If a company took government money, investors were clear that those same companies should not be paying bonuses to senior executives unless that money had been paid back. This is only fair.
We were very pleased to see that the vast majority of FTSE All-share companies met these expectations last year and set their pay outcomes in the context of the stakeholder experience. But as many companies have relied on government funding and still had staff on furlough at the start of this financial year, ensuring this fair approach is maintained will be critical for investors in the coming year.
By ensuring that company executive pay is fair, and linked to the future sustainability of the business, investment managers are helping the companies they invest in to thrive
Climate change is the single biggest risk facing our planet, society and business today, and investment managers are committed to supporting companies to manage their impact on the planet and the effect on their business.
These considerations are of increasing importance to people across the country. This year, retail savers invested on average more than £1bn a month into funds applying ESG considerations. There is no doubt that climate change affects every company, its customers, employees and shareholders.
With the recent COP26 conference focusing minds on the need to take action to address climate change, we have seen more companies link executive pay and bonuses to ESG metrics.
How a company is run will determine its long-term value, and shareholders need to know that company boards are planning now for the transition to a net zero future.
That’s why this year shareholders are asking that where ESG factors are part of a company’s strategy, these are similarly included in their remuneration and, where they aren’t, the board should explain to investors how they will do this in future years.
These expectations and all our principles fall equally on investment managers themselves. They&nbsp;take their impact on the planet very seriously and are rightly incorporating ESG risks into their strategies and their remuneration.
Investors have a responsibility to engage with the companies they invest in, to understand their strategy in order to support them to prosper, but also to hold them to account when need be. By ensuring that company executive pay is fair, and linked to the future sustainability of the business, investment managers are helping the companies they invest in to thrive in future years. This benefits the savers of today who will become the pensioners of tomorrow — and will reap the dividends of this prudent, long- term investment approach.

Alameda seeks millions of dollars from firms including George Osborne’s 9Yards,Alameda Research,"Alameda Research is seeking to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars paid to individuals and firms, including former UK chancellor George Osborne’s venture capital vehicle, in connection with a deal struck by Sam Bankman-Fried shortly before his FTX cryptocurrency empire entered bankruptcy last year.
Alameda, which is now being run by restructuring expert John Ray, alleged that Bankman-Fried and other insiders misappropriated FTX money to pay for the acquisition of Embed Financial, a start-up broker-dealer that had been touted as a way for the cryptocurrency group to expand its offerings into traditional financial securities.
In two lawsuits filed in Delaware on Wednesday, the company sought to reclaim millions of dollars from former Embed employees who received “retention” payments from the deal, as well as the company’s former shareholders.
Among the defendants are prominent Silicon Valley firms that held stakes in Embed, including Y Combinator, Bain Capital Ventures and 9Yards, where Osborne is a partner alongside his brother Theo.
Alameda’s lawyers want the defendants, including California-based 9Yards, to repay the money they received from the Embed transaction under bankruptcy laws that allow courts to unwind “fraudulent transfers” that are intended to take assets out of reach of creditors.
9Yards, which allegedly received about $46,000 from the transaction, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. None of the defendants are accused of any wrongdoing.
The complaint detailed an elaborate series of transactions involving multiple accounts at now-defunct Signature Bank that Alameda’s lawyers said were intended to create the false impression that the $220mn used to acquire Embed came from the personal accounts of Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives instead of the company.
A lawyer for Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular office hours.
With faulty technology and net revenue of only $25,000, Embed was worth a small fraction of the amount that Bankman-Fried’s team had agreed to pay for the broker-dealer, Alameda’s lawyers alleged in the filings.
They quoted from internal communications in the weeks before the merger in which Embed employees worried that FTX executives would notice technology flaws that could derail plans to add 10,000 users to a new FTX Stocks product.
“[The Embed platform] can’t really take ANY accounts,” wrote one employee, according to the filings.
Others relayed their previous experience of dealing with Bankman-Fried’s team when FTX became a customer of Embed. The FTX affiliate in question “didn’t do a ton of dd [due diligence]”, said one person, according to the filings. “I get a sense that they are [cowboy emoji] over there[.]”

Alibaba kicks off unit IPOs as revenue growth weakens,Alibaba,"Alibaba is planning to list its logistics and grocery businesses within the next 18 months and spin off its cloud division as the Chinese group commences a massive shake-up of its tech empire.
In its first financial results since the tech giant announced plans to split into six businesses, Alibaba kicked off the group’s break-up as it posted a single-digit rise in revenues during the first quarter.
The Chinese group on Thursday said revenues had risen 2 per cent in the three months to March to Rmb208bn ($30bn), compared with a year earlier.
Alibaba said the board had approved plans to execute an initial public offering for its Freshippo grocery business, expected to be completed within the next year. It is also seeking to list its Cainiao Smart Logistics in 12 to 18 months.
“We believe that these two companies are ready to go public,” said Daniel Zhang, the group’s chief executive, during an investor call.
Alibaba also revealed plans to completely spin off its struggling cloud business through a stock dividend to shareholders after completing a private fundraising round for the unit.
But the cloud computing arm’s recent struggles could dampen its valuation in private markets. In the first three months, the unit reported a 2 per cent fall in revenues year on year, the first quarterly sales decline on record.
“The cloud business is fundamentally different from other consumer-facing businesses. This will allow the cloud business to sharpen its business strategy and optimise operations,” said Zhang, adding that Alibaba intended for the business to become an independently listed company.
The announcements come less than two months after Alibaba revealed its plan to split into six business units in a radical break-up that comes after Beijing’s crackdown on China’s tech giants.
Alibaba on Thursday announced the six new chief executives and board members for the respective new entities.
Under the restructuring, the Alibaba holding group will retain full ownership of its domestic ecommerce businesses Tmall and Taobao, which generated more profits than the group as a whole in its last fiscal year.
Alibaba said businesses outside of domestic ecommerce will be “given a limited time period to access Alibaba group capital” before being cut off from the parent company financing.
Analysts have said that its lossmaking local consumer services unit, which includes its food delivery and Alibaba’s mapping app, may struggle to survive after being cut off from cash flow generated from the profitable ecommerce businesses.
Alibaba’s share price rallied following news of the split-up in March but has retreated close to pre-announcement levels amid investor concern over tepid spending on consumer goods and a slower than expected rebound in Chinese economic activity.
The group said net income was Rmb23.5bn in the first quarter, reversing losses during the same period last year due to one-off gains.
Revenue from its domestic ecommerce business was Rmb140bn, a decline of 3 per cent from the previous year.
Gross merchandise revenue on Tmall and Taobao decreased in mid-single digits as consumers shunned online shopping in favour of social-contact spending such as dining and visiting the cinema after China ended its zero-Covid policy late last year.
“In the past few months, we have noticed a gradual recovery in Chinese consumption, but consumer confidence and spending power still need further momentum,” said Zhang.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients that Taobao and Tmall’s high-profit margins mean Alibaba will “have the buffer to step up investments to defend its market share” in ecommerce amid “intensifying competition”.
They added that China’s reopening could see a “plateauing” of the livestream shopping format popularised by ByteDance’s Douyin during the pandemic.
Alibaba said on Thursday it had tested a new interface for its Taobao app that aimed to increase exposure for its livestream shopping channels, in a direct challenge to Douyin.
The group said it had spent more than $1.9bn to repurchase 21.5mn shares during the three-month period, or about 1 per cent of its outstanding share count. The group has about $19.4bn left to utilise as part of a previously authorised buyback programme.

Fund manager Amundi shifts assets from US to China,Amundi,"Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi is moving out of US assets in favour of China, attracted by the country’s brighter economic prospects, better valuations and a more benign outlook for inflation.
Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of the Paris-based fund firm, which has €2.1tn in assets, thinks “too much risk” is priced into Chinese credit and high-quality companies, while markets in the US are “too optimistic” as a recession looms.
“In our allocations we have made a clear shift from west to east,” Mortier said in an interview with the Financial Times, predicting that the US economy will not grow next year while China, India and Indonesia will each grow by 5 to 6 per cent.
Mortier’s bullish stance on the world’s second-largest economy comes as political tensions between Beijing and Washington worsen and recent consumer and industrial activity has fallen far short of expectations.
In late January, a top US air force general predicted that the US and China would probably go to war in 2025, and the following month Chinese spy balloons were discovered over the US.
While Mortier sees geopolitics as “a risk”, he thinks the balance of power is such that the US would try to avoid being too harsh on China. Amundi has been gradually increasing its allocation to China and India over the past 12 months, and has accelerated the move this year.
“The US should not underestimate the capacity of China to retaliate, to escalate and then to negotiate,” Mortier said. “I think China can make serious arguments to put pressure on the US as well.”&nbsp;
Mortier is particularly keen on opportunities in select Chinese corporate bonds, arguing that foreign investors have been blanket selling without differentiating between the quality of issuers.
“If you dig you can find really good companies that you can buy for 50 cents to the dollar,” he said. “If you are brave or if you have some time it’s very good.”
Amundi’s optimism on China comes despite a tough period for its equity markets. The CSI 300 index has shed 5.7 per cent from its January peak.
Markets have been pushed lower by disappointing economic data. Although China’s economy grew by a better than expected 4.5 per cent year on year in the first quarter, industrial production rose 5.6 per cent last month from a year earlier but well below forecasts of a 10.6 per cent rise. Retail sales figures also missed forecasts. But Mortier said he believed investor reaction might have been overblown.
“The data may seem disappointing, but when you dig more into the details in fact they are not that bad,” he said. “I think the markets may have not caught the reality of what is happening because there have been changes in how the data is produced.”
US markets are pricing in a “goldilocks” scenario of low inflation, rate cuts, stronger earnings and a soft landing, but the likelihood of this happening is becoming increasingly remote as financial conditions tighten, he said.
The US Federal Reserve’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey last week showed that 46 per cent of US banks plan to raise their lending standards owing to worries about loan losses and deposit flight.
Meanwhile, hourly wage growth was 4.4 per cent year on year in April, which is likely to put upward pressure on inflation.
Mortier thinks inflation in both the US and Europe will stabilise at around 3 to 4 per cent in the years ahead, but with some volatility that will make the Fed’s job particularly difficult owing to the time it takes for monetary policy to have an impact.
However, he is not worried about the possibility of a US debt default, which has sent the cost of insuring against US Treasury default soaring this year to its highest level since the financial crisis.
“We think Treasuries are safe,” he said. “We are continuing to manage this exposure like business as usual and even taking some opportunity” to buy some.
Nevertheless, he favours emerging markets over western markets as a whole and is upping allocation to both India and Indonesia where, like China, economic growth is becoming less dependent on exports.
“This is good news for these countries and less good news for the West,” he said."
AngloGold Ashanti to switch primary listing to New York,AngloGold Ashanti Ltd,"AngloGold Ashanti has announced plans to switch its primary stock market listing to New York, a sign that Wall Street rather than London has become the preferred destination for the world’s biggest gold miners.
Under a plan set out on Friday, the world’s fourth-largest gold miner will move its primary listing from Johannesburg to New York as part of an effort to lift its valuation. The group said it would retain a secondary listing in its historic base in Johannesburg and another in Ghana.
With roots in the mining empire built by Ernest Oppenheimer more than a century ago, AngloGold’s move follows the sale of its remaining South African operations in 2020. It also comes as the London market, the traditional home to many of the world’s largest miners, tries to counter the growing pull of New York.
Chief executive Alberto Calderon said making New York its primary listing would give AngloGold access to the “world’s largest capital markets and pool of gold investors”.
“It’s such a compelling case for change — we have no operations in South Africa, a bigger pool of gold capital in New York and not tied to South African rating discount,” Calderon told the Financial Times.
While a handful of gold miners are listed in London, the world’s biggest, Newmont, is listed in New York. AngloGold says Wall Street-listed competitors trade at a significant premium.
AngloGold already has a secondary listing in New York, which the company says generates about two-thirds of the daily trading in its shares. That helped convince the company of New York’s merits, alongside what Calderon said was a fear of damaging the liquidity in its stock if it were to also have a London listing.
Gold miners are betting that New York would help them gain access to passive funds that invest in gold, which is trading near a record high.
As part of the plan, AngloGold said it would redomicile in the UK from South Africa, in part because its main holding company subsidiary has been based in the UK since 2017.
Calderon said redomiciling would also help win investor backing for switching the listing to New York because it would spare its South African shareholders from paying a tax on dividends.
After scaling back in South Africa, AngloGold’s operations are now focused elsewhere in Africa, Australia and the Americas.
The group’s decision to opt for New York is a blow to London, which has few large precious metals miners: Fresnillo, Endeavour Mining and Centamin are among the biggest. It lost Randgold when Canada’s Barrick Gold acquired the group in 2018.
AngloGold’s exit deepens the woes of South Africa’s mining industry, which is already battling persistent problems with its power supply.
South African regulators have approved its plan, the company said. The South African government has historically been reluctant to let major companies move overseas.
The miner said the move would cost it $560mn, mainly in taxes to the South African government. It expects to complete the moves, which will require the approval of 75 per cent of shareholders, in the third quarter.
AngloGold on Friday reported adjusted core earnings of $320mn in the three months to March, down 26 per cent on a year earlier, on production of 584,000 ounces."
AI is the new ESG,Artificial intelligence,"Morgan Stanley has some reflections on the year’s strange, narrow, tech-powered equities rally. It’s like corporate responsibility but instead of stakeholder principles there are GPU rigs, apparently:
The ongoing AI debate resembles the early stages of the ESG asset upswing, when investors divided their portfolio into ESG-positive and ESG-negative narratives. Most non-tech investors are not at the point of quantifying what AI means for their portfolios’ earnings expectations, but appear wary that others may be starting to think about a bottom-up reassessment of their holdings’ terminal growth and margin assumptions for this new paradigm. For ESG this process started in earnest in 2018-2020 and remains an ongoing debate, more recently evolving to a rate-of-change debate. Some investors believe AI will follow — or already is following — a similar bifurcation process.
To recap, the S&amp;P 500 is up 8 per cent so far this year because a few AI-adjacent companies have gained 20 per cent plus. The biggest five stocks in the index account for 75 per cent of its performance and have grown to nearly 20 per cent of its weighting. Exclude them and the S&amp;P would be off 2 per cent in 2023.
And mostly, investors are thinking about it wrong, Morgan Stanley says. AI’s not the new electric vehicle because it’s more broadly disruptive than that . . .
The transition to EVs is a favoured analogy from recent history. This is not comparable in our view. EVs are not a “platform + killer app” transition from combustion engines in the way Generative AI is. Nonetheless, the investment conclusions are not dissimilar. Just as with the EV transition, in AI it is too early to determine the non-tech winners post-transition. Therefore, the unknown but non-zero capital investment required for incumbents to keep pace with disruptors likely requires a higher discount rate on certain equities (or their sum of the parts) until there is better clarity on (1) long term ROIIC; (2) competitive dynamics; (3) AI strategies from companies.
. . . but when talking about all this coming disruption, the bank’s clients don’t seem particularly imaginative:
Most generalist investors we have met prefer to think about the market even more simply still: businesses driven by tangible assets vs businesses driven by intangibles. The latter requiring further analysis and possibly higher cost of capital than previously. And the former — whilst less scalable — could be relative outperformers over the short- to medium-term as the market assesses when and how these AI dynamics flows through to top line or EBIT across sectors and companies. Proprietary data and the quality thereof, will become a much more important metric in this new world of tangible vs intangible discussions, but one which — in the absence of companies giving more detail — will entail subjective determinations by investors. Tangible industries being leaned on most regularly include electrification/grid names, renewables and aerospace.
In the meantime, Morgan Stanley has been telling them to buy media and publishing companies such as Pearson, because they have big proprietary data sets on which to train large language models.
“Periods of euphoria” will probably follow the current Chegg-inspired gloom, though investors usually assume the worst until proven otherwise, it says:
Investors are likely to focus increasingly on the responses of management teams to the new technology, rewarding those with credible strategies and investment plans, and punishing those without a coherent plan.
So, nothing whatsoever like ESG.

Could anxiety about generative AI prompt a broader rethink of whether technology companies really count as ethical investments?
Shares of educational tech company Chegg nearly halved after it admitted earlier this week that some students had been turning towards artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT rather than its human tutors.
Louise Piffaut, head of ESG integration for equity stocks at Aviva Investors, told me yesterday this crisis could “wake up” investors who have until now “misunderstood” how exposed technology companies are to AI.
Some people might suspect their internet provider of excessive surveillance when a spookily well-targeted advert pops up, Piffaut says, “but that’s probably where it stops for the average retail investor”. But in reality, she adds, “the different forms of artificial intelligence including biometrics, Siri and Alexa . . . all have ESG risks that have been largely under-appreciated”.
From a climate perspective, AI will probably drive tech company energy usage (which is already sky-high) even higher.
Then there are human rights issues, like racial bias in facial recognition or the potential for mass surveillance, which the European parliament, among others, has been preparing to crack down on. A 75-year-old British scientist seen as the godfather of modern AI told the New York Times this week he had quit Google, in part because it’s “hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things”.
These ethical issues come as companies are scrambling to adapt. Chegg. for example, said it was now “embracing [generative AI] aggressively”, tackling the threat by launching its own service that lets students talk to an AI-powered chatbot directly. Read on for my story on how one AI-focused data company thinks the latest iteration could transform the way clients think about risk.

The next FT Moral Money Forum report will dig deep into carbon markets, and we want to hear from you. Do you favour carbon taxes? Can voluntary markets overcome quality concerns? Will compliance markets do more to push business to decarbonise? Share your thoughts here.
Artificial intelligence is actually quite retro in the ESG world, according to the chief commercial officer at RepRisk, the Zurich-based due diligence company that has been scouring the web for evidence of corporate wrongdoing since 2007.
Back then, AI was mostly thought of as a time-saving exercise. Like many others, the company created a giant web-scraping tool that mimicked the ability of human analysts to quickly read a news article or NGO report and understand the strength of claims about a toxic oil spill or a dispute with a trade union.
This tool has blossomed to scan half a million documents every day in 23 languages. It throws out the least credible or relevant claims and alerts analysts in Zurich, Toronto or Manila to the ones that could be worth reviewing.
More recently it has taken things one step further with so-called “machine learning”, putting 16 years of human feedback back into its system to teach it which sources to trust and how to interpret them. RepRisk’s clients include Standard Chartered and ING, among more than 80 banks, as well as insurers, private equity players, hedge funds and asset managers.
“We need to be able to read between the lines when a company is criticised,” Alexandra Mihailescu Cichon told Moral Money. “We feel strongly about the need for curation. The information needs to be actionable.” For example, for cultural reasons, Japanese-language sources are likely to couch criticism in gentler terms than those from the US — something a simple translation tool might struggle to pick up.
Prediction is the next frontier. RepRisk has cross-referenced the location of “environmentally sensitive sites” with millions of its own risk reports in the hope of flagging possible future issues. Extractive projects within 1km of these sites faced a 77 per cent higher risk of public criticism for environmental incidents between 2007 and 2022 compared with those 30km away, according to RepRisk research. For private companies, which tend to face less scrutiny, risk increased by 27 per cent. In both cases proximity to a Unesco world heritage site raised the risk even further.
Knowing all this could give investors a better chance at getting out early, Cichon argues. The controversial East African Crude Oil Pipeline, for example, set to run from Uganda to the Tanzanian coast, is within 1km of 33 environmentally sensitive sites, according to RepRisk data.
Not all agree that a predictive approach to ESG is helpful. “The industry hates black boxes,” Aviva’s Piffaut told me. “If you have an AI-led score that you cannot explain because it’s full of code, and a model you don’t understand because you’re not a data engineer, it doesn’t drive the transparency we need right now.”&nbsp;
Fadi Zaher, head of index funds at UK-based Legal &amp; General Investment Management, warned that the lack of regulation for ESG data means there may not be much point to predictive AI for the moment. “If you’re feeding it poor quality information it will spit out poorer quality output.”
In the case of the pipeline, it is hard to think that any fund manager would have missed this risk. Still, some like the insurance broker Marsh McLennan chose to back it even as it was publicly shunned by major banks and insurers. Putting biodiversity risk data in quantifiable terms could go a long way with investors. (Kenza Bryan)
The Milken Institute conference taking place in Los Angeles this week has featured extensive debate about AI — along with hot topics such as the American debt ceiling, banking stress, war in Ukraine and deteriorating US-China relations.
Another issue sparking unexpected interest is the extraordinary ambition now emerging from Saudi Arabia.
This creates a conundrum for global businesses that aspire to have ethical standards. As Saudi government and business leaders have argued at Milken, the Kingdom has outlined a bold ambition to refocus its economy away from its current reliance on fossil fuels with a so-called “Vision 2030” plan of reforms. So after investing $300bn in new infrastructure last year, the government plans to invest another $3tn (yes, trillion) before 2030. And to support this, the government is overhauling its capital markets, introducing green energy projects, unleashing mass digitisation and even embracing some social reforms, such as a dramatic increase in the proportion of women in the workplace. Hooray.
This creates potentially lucrative opportunities for investors in general. And the focus on green energy should excite ESG enthusiasts in particular. But the Kingdom has had an infamously bad human rights record in the past, epitomised by the gruesome murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And while ESG investors have sometimes downplayed such human rights issues when chasing green projects, the speed at which western businesses were forced to pull out of Russia last year has left many nervous about half-understood political risks. “Some investors simply won’t put Saudi projects into an ESG basket,” one asset manager told me in Milken.
The Saudi delegation says this is unfair: it told investors in Milken that events such as Khashoggi’s murder were isolated ones that will not be repeated in the future. “It is in the past,” the mantra went. Hopefully so. But if these bold investment plans — and green pledges — keep rolling out, the Kingdom will present an interesting test case for how to define ESG. We will be watching closely.

BNP Paribas to stop funding new gas projects as litigation risk mounts,BNP Paribas SA,"BNP Paribas has said it will no longer finance new gasfield projects, further restricting some of its funding for fossil fuels, as campaigners pursue lawsuits against the eurozone’s biggest bank for supporting the sector.
The French banking group on Thursday joined other leading fossil fuel lenders such as HSBC in extending a previous commitment on new oil projects to include some gas activities, an area where clients such as BP and TotalEnergies have big operations.
But climate activists noted that most of the bank’s support for oil and gas is given through corporate loans and bond underwriting services, not the direct loans that BNP has addressed in its new policy. Alexandre Poidatz, Oxfam France’s head of advocacy, said the move was “a big step according to BNP, but a small step for humanity”.
The bank has previously committed to restricting its lending to companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production by 2030 — by 80 per cent for oil and 30 per cent for gas. Campaigners argue this leaves the door open to underwriting services for oil and lending to gas companies.
BNP is at present in the top 20 of the world’s biggest financial backers for companies in the oil and gas sector. The latest annual ranking by the Rainforest Action Network estimated that BNP had provided $20.8bn worth of financing to the sector in 2022, more than other European banks, and a total of $165bn since 2016 following the Paris climate agreement.
BNP said in January that its outstanding loans for gas extraction and production stood at €5.3bn at the end of 2022. It said its loans to cleaner energy sources, a category in which it includes renewable power and nuclear energy, stood at just over €28bn, compared with almost €24bn for fossil fuels.
It said on Thursday it would also cease so-called reserve-based lending, where loans are secured against oil reserves of companies taking on debt.

The bank, like many others involved in financing fossil fuels, has argued that it is accompanying companies as they pivot towards cleaner energy sources and is providing funding accordingly.
Lucie Pinson, founder of campaign group Reclaim Finance, said BNP should commit to “progressively restrict all of its financial services to companies” that did not drop all of their new oil and gas projects. “This is the only way for BNP to help prevent and arm itself against the risk of the climate situation worsening,” she added.
Pressure on BNP to detail its climate strategy and do more to cut support for fossil fuels has increased in recent months. The bank faces a lawsuit brought by Oxfam, Friends of the Earth and Notre Affaire à Tous in a French court, on the grounds that its financing for the industry breaches a legally binding duty in France to ensure its activities do not harm the environment.
Lorette Philippot, campaign lead at Friends of the Earth France, said BNP’s move was a “step in the right direction” but “sadly failed to respond to an elementary and urgent demand . . . to stop supporting the development of any new oil and gasfields”. The focus on oil created a “two-speed policy” that allowed the bank to finance gas expansion, including by French energy giant Total, Philippot added.
A group of scientists wrote to the bank on Monday ahead of its annual shareholder meeting next week, challenging it to recognise a “scientific consensus” that investments in new gas projects, not just coal, must be “immediately stopped”.
Its signatories included scientists involved in the latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which warned that the world had a “brief and rapidly closing window” to adapt to climate change."
BP to feel the heat over curtailed climate vow,BP PLC,"The shareholder registers of oil companies these days resemble a pack of gerbils fighting under a blanket. There are those who want the companies to cut oil and gas production targets and to do it yesterday, those who want to make as much money as possible right now, and everything in between.
BP’s annual general meeting this Thursday will provide a handy illustration of this phenomenon — and of the pitfalls companies can encounter when trying to steer an uncertain course.
Some British pension funds, led by Nest, are set to vote against the reappointment of chair Helge Lund. These groups, which don’t own many shares in BP but manage the assets of a lot of people, disapprove of the company’s decision to row back on its climate targets. They don’t believe the new targets are appropriate, and are concerned that BP did not put them to a shareholder vote.
Separately, Dutch climate group Follow This has filed a shareholder resolution asking BP to commit to “Paris aligned” 2030 targets. While the lines are blurred, Follow This are activists, rather than investors, who crowdfund to buy a few shares and get a resolution on the slate. That doesn’t make them insignificant, though. Their similar resolutions got more than 20 per cent of the vote in 2021, and 14.5 per cent in 2022.
These rebellious shareholders raise two big questions for oil groups. The first is about how ambitious their climate targets should be. And the second is about who should be responsible for taking this decision.
It is hard not to have some sympathy for the activists at BP. While there is no clear “Paris aligned” pathway to 2050 for the oil sector, experts agree that overall emissions need to be cut by some 45 per cent by 2030. BP might argue that its climate targets are collectively Paris compliant. But its new intermediate target — for a 25 per cent production cut by 2030 — is clearly less Paris-friendly than its old one, which was for a 40 per cent cut.
That said, it isn’t like BP is doing nothing. A 25 per cent production cut is still best in class. On top of that, it has upped investment in renewables, and remains committed to net zero by 2050. Moreover, BP’s stock rose nearly 20 per cent after it watered down environmental targets, suggesting that not everyone believes being “Paris aligned” is the best way for the company to create shareholder value.
There is a broader point, too. If European oil majors cut production by 40 per cent by 2030, but the global economy fails to transition fast enough, the fossil fuels required will be supplied by other oil companies, perhaps those owned by petrostates themselves. Activists might find it fruitful to accompany their requests for production cuts with some for demand curtailment, forcing oil-consuming companies to commit to biofuels and clean electricity.
BP’s AGM also raises the question of what sorts of things should be up to shareholders to decide, and what responsibilities need to stay with boards. While Norges, Norway’s sovereign fund, has not said why it is voting against Follow This, major investors tend to eschew resolutions that tie the board’s hands. A similar sort of argument can be made against Nest’s complaint. For oil companies, letting shareholders have a “say on climate” is not dissimilar to letting them have a say on strategy, which has traditionally been the remit of directors.
That said, BP has rather shot itself in the foot on this one. It invited shareholders to vote on its original climate targets last year, but didn’t put the new curtailed ones up for consultation this year.
The explanation for this apparently inconsistent behaviour appears to be that last year’s targets were not explicitly the subject of a resolution. They were enshrined in a report on climate progress, which shareholders were asked to support. As luck would have it, there is no climate report for anyone to support, or otherwise, this year.
That looks confusing, at best. As BP charts a course in these new waters and grapples with such important issues about the future of the industry, it might do well to eschew slipperiness and try for clarity and transparency instead.

The Pause — visualised,Bank of England,"OK, central banks still seem far away from actually cutting interest rates — the much-vaunted Pivot! that many investors have been praying for — but the overall pace of tightening has collapsed.
This may seem like an odd thing to say, after the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank all jacked up their main policy rate this spring, with the BoE announcing another quarter point rise to 4.5 per cent just yesterday.
However, in the three months to April there were only 48 rate increases across the 57 central banks that the FT tracks — about half those over the same period for most of the second half of 2022 and the lowest figure since the three months to February 2022.
This is because many central banks in emerging markets have already paused their monetary tightening, with Canada also joining their rank as it held rates unchanged in the last two meetings. Here’s William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics:
Most EM central banks have drawn their monetary tightening cycles to a close now and, if history is any guide, it looks like the conditions will be in place for an easing cycle to start from around July/August.
In Latin America, Brazil has left its policy rate unchanged since August last year, Chile hasn’t increased rates since October and Peru has been on pause since the start of 2023. Across 12 countries in central and Latin America there were 11 rate increases in the three months to April, less than half the number in the summer last year.
In eastern Europe, where inflation has been higher than in the rest of the continent, the picture is similar. In the three months to April, there were 12 rate increases across 18 countries, down from a peak of 24 rate rises in the three months to February 2022. This comes as Romania paused its rate increases at the start of the year, Poland in September 2022, while Romania and the Czech Republic announced their last increase in June 2022.
The EM pause is largely because many developing countries started ratcheting up interest rates far earlier and with more alacrity than western central banks to quell inflation. Brazil, for example, lifted its Selic target rate already in March 2021, nearly one and half year earlier than the ECB, and it now stands at a hefty 13.75 per cent — more than twice as high as the current inflation rate.
So when is the pivot to lower rates going to start?
Some countries — such as Vietnam, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Angola — have already cut interest rates. Capital Economics predicts that South Korea, Hungary and Chile will be among the next to ease monetary policy, and markets are pricing some probability of a rate cut at the next meeting for India, Poland, Colombia, Chile, Brazil and the Czech Republic.
Here’s Jackson again, with his emphasis below:
Unsurprisingly, having been the first to hike, EM central banks also brought their tightening cycles to an end long before DM central banks . . . So the monetary policy tide seems to be shifting.
. . . Historically, EM central banks have tended to turn from tightening to loosening monetary conditions quite rapidly. In the past few decades, central banks have waited around four months on average between ending their hiking cycle and delivering their first rate cut. Typically, the larger the preceding tightening cycle, the quicker the move to interest rate cuts.
But as every macroeconomist knows, Réal Pivöts can only be produced in the Washington region of America, with some also arguing that the terroirs in Frankfurt, London and Tokyo are not to be sniffed at. When are we likely to see those hit the market?
Well, markets seem pretty convinced that the Fed pause is now in, and the economic fallout from tightening credit conditions will spur cuts later this year. Others major central banks expected to follow.
George Cole, economist at Goldman Sachs said that his base case “is that G10 central banks will in general complete their hiking cycles relatively soon, before ultimately lowering rates in years to come.”
Not that investors should be looking forward to that, notes Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen.
Consensus expectations call for interest rate cuts by the end of 2023, but we expect rates to remain higher for longer. A Fed pivot may sound like a tailwind for risk assets, but such a shift won’t occur in a vacuum. In fact, what ultimately causes the Fed to cut — a slowing economy that devolves into a recession — is bound to be a negative for markets. Until then, continued tightness in the labor market, along with stubbornly sticky areas of inflation and a contentious political landscape in Washington, D.C., should cause volatility to pick up in the coming weeks."
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bet almost $1bn on credit card issuer Capital One,Berkshire Hathaway Inc,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway placed a $954mn bet on credit card and banking company Capital One in the first quarter, one of the few new stakes added by the investment group in a period when it was dumping billions of dollars worth of stocks.
The disclosure of the investment on Monday signalled Berkshire’s and Buffett’s comfort with the credit card industry and the health of consumers’ pocketbooks even as several regional banks have been swept up in financial turmoil. Capital One describes itself as the third largest issuer of Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the US.
Berkshire has concentrated its financial industry investments on a handful of large US banks — Bank of America and Citigroup — as well as credit card companies including American Express, Visa and Mastercard.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chief executive, earlier this month struck a cautious tone about the prospects of the banking industry, warning that the speed of bank runs in an age of online accounts had changed the calculus of investing in the sector.
“You don’t know what happened to the stickiness of deposits at all . . . and that changes everything,” he told shareholders gathered in Omaha for the company’s annual meeting. “You can have a run in a few seconds.”
The regulatory disclosure on Monday also showed Berkshire exited its positions in US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon in the first quarter.
The 2.6 per cent stake Berkshire purchased in Capital One complements its large bet on auto and home lender Ally Financial, which it made last year. Berkshire modestly trimmed its position in Ally in the first quarter.
Shares of Capital One jumped 6 per cent in after-hours trading.
Capital One has been increasing its provisions for credit losses as the economy slows and inflation nips at the heels of consumers. But the company has not been engulfed by the same fears that have weighed on the broader banking industry. Its shares have fallen about 4 per cent this year, compared to a 26 per cent drop by the KBW bank index.
Berkshire also disclosed it had cut its stake in oil major Chevron by about a fifth, selling roughly 35mn shares between its own accounts and an investment portfolio managed by a subsidiary.
The company exited its remaining position in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, with Buffett hinting at the geopolitical tension between Taiwan and China for the share sales this year and last year."
Binance slams US crypto crackdown and makes bid for UK oversight,Binance,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has said a crackdown on crypto has made it “very difficult” to do business in the US, adding that it now hopes to be regulated in the UK.
Patrick Hillmann, the company’s chief strategy officer, said at the Financial Times’ crypto and digital assets summit that the US “has been very confusing over the past six months”. He pointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s actions against rival exchange Coinbase over alleged securities laws violations as a sign of how “the US right now is in this weird place”.
In contrast with his comments that it was now a “very difficult time” to do business in the US, Hillmann said Binance would do “everything we possibly can” to be regulated in the UK.
Binance had previously clashed with London regulators who said the exchange was incapable of being regulated after it failed to provide basic information about its business activity. The group has no fixed headquarters and offers services around the world.
In 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority ordered the company to stop all regulated activities in Britain, and last year a joint venture partner said the company had filed a “grossly inaccurate” annual report for one of its UK subsidiaries.
Hillman declined to confirm whether the company had reapplied to the FCA’s registration regime for crypto businesses, which covers companies’ processes to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.
Other groups have claimed that UK officials have been overly wary of fintech and crypto companies. This week, the head of payments company Revolut blamed “extra cautious” UK regulators for delays in gaining its banking licence.
Binance has been the target of US regulators clamping down on perceived illicit activity this year.
In March. the Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought a lawsuit against the group, alleging it had been operating illegally in the country and had broken the law by extensively soliciting US customers. At the time, Binance called the CFTC complaint “unexpected and disappointing”.
The Department of Justice also named Binance as a counterparty to Bitzlato, a crypto exchange whose founder was charged with transmitting millions of illicit crypto funds in violation of US money-laundering regulations.
Binance’s US affiliate, Binance US, last month abandoned a proposed $1bn deal for the assets belonging to Voyager Digital, a crypto lender that fell into bankruptcy last year.
Hillmann said the “broader regulatory pivot we’ve seen in the US” was different from Binance’s discussions with the CFTC. However he played down the threat of US enforcement actions on the company and the industry, saying: “I expect at some point the US is going to want to pivot and play catch-up to Europe, which just passed Mica [the EU’s crypto asset regulation], which is a huge step forward.”
The EU legislation is intended to provide a framework for regulating crypto assets in the bloc, so giving greater certainty to consumers and market participants.
The Binance enforcement case is one of many brought by US regulators against some of the biggest companies in the crypto industry.
Among them, Nasdaq-listed Coinbase is the focus of an SEC investigation into possible securities laws violation. Crypto payments company Ripple is also engaged in a long-running lawsuit brought by the SEC in 2020 alleging it violated securities laws.

El Salvador hasn’t defaulted. Don’t thank Bitcoin,Bitcoin,"Did a bitcoin per day keep default away? So El Salvador’s crypto-touting Presidente would have us believe.&nbsp;
Since January, the country has led Citi’s emerging market sovereign bond index as the top outperformer year to date, with returns of 22.2 per cent.
And in late January, Nayib Bukele announced (over Twitter, of course) that his country had dodged default. With help from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), El Salvador repaid in full an $800mn bond which was set to mature a week later.&nbsp;
Throughout his presidency, Bukele has spooked investors and conventional financiers like the IMF. The prices of its bonds began to tumble in mid 2021, after Bukele did normal dictator-like things, like firing judges and brutal crackdowns. Worse still was Bukele’s face plant into cryptomania. After embracing Bitcoin and buying up plenty (2,381 as of last November), the cryptocurrency selfishly collapsed.
Rating agency Fitch said a “default of some sort” was probable downgrading the country’s debt into junk territory. Moody’s did the same. At their nadir in July 2022, El Salvadoran bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 traded at 26.38 and 25.13 cents on the dollar respectively.
But times have changed. In February, Moody’s changed its outlook from negative to stable, citing a “decreased risk of a credit event in the near term” and “manageable” repayments on the 2025 bond. Its 2025 and 2027 debts are now trading at 78.39 and 55.92 cents on the dollar.&nbsp;
So, ¿Que pasa?
After settling the bond, Bukele turned his wrath on the media. “[A]lmost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our “#Bitcoin bet”, El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023,” he lamented, claiming there were “[l]iterally, hundreds of articles” that did so (while apparently struggling to find very many of them).
Bukele has connected his making Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021 with the country’s improved economic fortunes, saying it gave El Salvador an “advantage in the new economic system” and spurred private investment from “people escaping censorship.”
But was it really Bitcoin that helped El Salvador dodge default? Perhaps the truth is much more mundane.&nbsp;
El Salvador regained many investors’ graces in July 2022, after announcing a $1.6bn bond buyback using special drawing rights from the IMF and a $200mn loan from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. Buybacks in September and December reduced the principal for the 2025 bond to $348mn from $800mn.&nbsp;
“The buybacks to some extent fixed their communication issues. They changed from catering to the crypto community back to catering to traditional investors,” says Esteban Tamayo, a Citi economist covering the region.
The country is even earning something of a reputation for financial prudence.
“When you dig in, while El Salvador has its share of difficulties, the amount of debt is manageable and the budget is under control,” says Aaron Stern, chief investment officer and managing partner at Converium Capital.
According to Fitch, the government’s fiscal deficit was 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2022, down from 5.7 per cent in 2021 and 10.1 per cent in 2020 - driven by the post-pandemic economic rebound, subsidy cuts and enhanced tax collection.&nbsp;
“There was a windfall of revenues in 2022, because there was better compliance on income tax collection. If you’re in a somewhat autocratic country, you’re going to be motivated to pay your income taxes,” says Siobhan Morden, managing director Latin America fixed income strategy at Santander Investment Securities.&nbsp;
Public debt has also decreased to 78 per cent of GDP, down from 82.4 per cent in 2021.&nbsp;
The IMF says the economy is bound for moderate real GDP growth in 2023, 1.7 per cent, after expanding by 2.8 per cent the previous year. This is in line with its peers in Latin America and the Caribbean, but below its peers in the emerging and developing economies bracket.&nbsp;
While Bukele’s anti-crime initiatives have not endeared him to human rights advocates, the “unprecedented reduction in crime” has contributed to robust economic and investment activity, says the IMF. Bukele asked congress to agree to a state of emergency last March, giving him the power to go after the notorious Barrio 18 and MS-13 gangs. However, he is accused of sweeping up and disappearing innocents as well as gang operatives. Less crime means there’s plenty to like for investors, as well as tourist fans of Bitcoin, surfing, and the Miss Universe pageant. Less so for critics of arbitrary detentions and cattle pen prisons.&nbsp;
Meanwhile investors are heartened that the government has some additional levers to pull. In December the government passed a pension system reform bill which imposed a cap of $3,000 per month and gave it the ability to tap into private pension savings as a source of income. While dipping into pension pots would be a bold move for even a popular President, investors are somewhat assured that the option is open.&nbsp;
“There is still budget flexibility… fiscal adjustment could occur under the inertia and spending constraints of dollarisation since you cannot spend what you cannot borrow, ” Santander said in a note.
It also looks like Bukele’s bitcoin dalliance hasn’t sunk the ship — for now. Partially, this is because it has bombed. In the concluding statement of its January mission, the IMF said that the “risks have not materialised due to the limited Bitcoin use so far,” — according to the University of Chicago, less than 20 per cent of businesses accept it alongside the greenback. The mooted volcano bonds, meanwhile, are going out with a whimper — “our view is that traditional investors won’t participate – making it less likely that they will try to issue it,” said Tamayo. The experiment flopping has proven a help rather than a hindrance.
But whether the world’s most online dictator can keep the wheels on is a different question. The current account deficit rose to 8 per cent of GDP in 2022, due to skyrocketing import volumes, with international reserves falling to around two months of imports.&nbsp;
“They’ve been smashing up their reserves, which is never a good plan,” says Stephen Bailey-Smith, a portfolio manager at Global Evolution. “For me they need to further tighten up monetarily, at least in order to maintain the spread with the Federal Reserve funds rate to stem import demand and prevent locals taking money offshore”.
The same pension reform which gave the government dipping rights also increased entitlements by 30 per cent, likely creating larger liabilities for El Salvador’s treasury.
The country’s domestic debt stock, 8.75 per cent of GDP, is high too, due to high spending and tax revenue hits during Covid-19. It still has nine international dollar bonds worth $6.4bn, roughly 30 per cent of its gross domestic product.
Access to international capital markets is a further issue, with Moody’s saying the 2025 bond payments are achievable “so long as multilateral disbursements remain around programmed levels.” An IMF deal also looks elusive.&nbsp;
“If you have a high debt stock you’re not going to be able to reduce that overnight, you have to generate a primary fiscal surplus for several years to work that down,” says Siobhan Morden from Santander Investment Securities.
“The problem that El Salvador has is that there are very limited financing alternatives, they’ve saturated their local markets and they do not get a lot of access to multilateral money, because they do not have an IMF program.”
And with an election coming up, investors are fretting about whether Bukele can keep the purse strings tight.
“He’s held expenditure quite flat, which is really encouraging. But can he continue to do that, in the year before the [February 2024] election?” asks Bailey-Smith.
While it was Bukele’s crypto capers that captured headlines, his real priorities seem much more pedestrian.

Traders grow wary of ‘unloved’ bitcoin rally,Bitcoin,"Cryptocurrency trading activity has dwindled even as bitcoin enjoys its longest winning streak in more than two years, in a sign that many investors are increasingly reluctant to buy into the rebound after a string of collapses and scandals in 2022.
The price of bitcoin, the most popular token, has risen 70 per cent this year, helping the market regain some momentum following the failure of companies like exchange FTX.
Investors have shrugged off lawsuits from US regulators against companies such as Binance, the industry’s largest exchange, and the collapsed stablecoin operator Terraform Labs, as authorities have sought to clamp down on activity they see as illegal.
However, the price of bitcoin has since been stuck in a rut for more than a month, trading in a narrow range around $28,000. That pause has been accompanied by thinning volumes, with small trades increasingly able to move market prices.
“While bitcoin’s recent performance is great on the face of it, many in crypto are calling this year an unloved rally,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index provider.
“Sentiment hasn’t changed, and regulatory scrutiny is sidelining a lot of new money that might otherwise enter the space. Price movements don’t mean much if the industry isn’t making meaningful progress to regain trust and attract new investors,” he added.
A bruising 2022 has left investors nursing losses or funds trapped in limbo as failed cryptocurrency lenders and exchanges go through bankruptcy proceedings in the courts.
Crypto enthusiasts also argued confidence has been renewed by the weakness in the global banking sector, and the vast outflow of deposits from banks such as the US’s Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, and Credit Suisse in Switzerland.

“That rally we experienced after the banking crisis earlier this year seemed to be directly related to a flight for safety and self-custody of funds away from the dollar,” said Edmond Goh, head of trading at crypto broker B2C2.
But that sentiment has been undermined by a host of signals coming from crypto markets. Analysts point out that the rally in cryptocurrency prices was already built on a thinly traded market.
The degree to which a market can absorb large orders without major changes to the price of bitcoin has declined since the start of the year, according to data provider CCData.
In January it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins, roughly equivalent to $23mn at the time, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent of its prevailing market value, CCData said.
Towards the end of last month it would have taken only 462 bitcoins, worth about $13mn, to move market prices by 1 per cent, the lowest point of market depth for the bitcoin-tether trading pair since May 2022, when the industry plunged into crisis.
“Prices are recovering, but liquidity has yet to return. No exchange or market maker has yet to fill the space that FTX and [its sister trading arm] Alameda once encompassed,” said Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.
Investors who have bought into bitcoin in recent months are now holding on to their investments.
Glassnode, a crypto data provider, said “there has been remarkably little expenditure” by investors who bought bitcoin when it hit a two-year low after FTX’s failure last November.
“The ‘FOMO’ that drove a lot of first time institutional and retail investors last year is obviously not happening now, despite the fact the crypto markets have rallied significantly this year,” said one crypto fund manager based in Dubai, referring to a fear of missing out.
Moreover, there have been outflows of $72mn over the last two weeks in digital asset investments, ending a six-week run of consecutive inflows, according to CoinShares. The crypto investment group ascribed the trend to the likeliness of further interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve.
Traders are also worried that the heavy clouds that have overshadowed the industry for the past 12 months have not fully gone away. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is likely to be pulled into a drawn-out lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Another cloud is the fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, which filed for bankruptcy in January owing more than $3bn after the implosion of FTX.
Owner Digital Currency Group, one of the world’s largest owner of bitcoins via its asset management arm, is looking to raise funds to pay back Genesis creditors. DCG said last week some Genesis creditors had walked away from a previously agreed restructuring deal.
The market appears to be “in a holding pattern pending the resolution of DCG’s debt payments”, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.
The uncertainty, along with the crisis in the US regional banking industry, has underscored for many that the market is still working through its many issues.
“There still isn’t a lot of organic momentum behind cryptocurrencies,” said Safai. “The headline events that propel cryptocurrency prices past sticking points . . are few and far between.”`

BlackRock calls employees back to the office four days a week,BlackRock Inc,"BlackRock will require employees to go to the office for at least four days a week, the latest company to curtail liberal work-from-home policies enacted in the Covid-19 pandemic.
The New York-based asset manager with about 20,000 employees in more than 30 countries said that from September 11, staff would be able to work from home just one day a week, according to an internal memo.
“We encourage you to transition into this model by increasing your in-office days, as your schedule permits, over the next few months,” said the memo signed by Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer, and Caroline Heller, head of human resources.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $9tn under management, joins a growing corporate push to have employees spend more time in the office. JPMorgan Chase announced in April that it would require managing directors to return to the office five days a week.
The order will provide modest relief to owners of offices and adjacent businesses that have suffered as work from home persists. Office occupancy in New York City is still just under 50 per cent — about the same as the national average — according to a barometer produced by Kastle Systems, the company that operates the security systems in many buildings.
Speaking to investors in February, Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, one of New York’s largest office landlords, conceded that the five-day work week was finished. “I think you can assume that Friday is dead forever,” Roth said. Monday, he added, was “touch and go”.
BlackRock’s order adds a day to its current requirement of three days a week in the office. It said its new policies were meant to encourage collaboration and training. “Career development happens in teaching moments between team members, and it is accelerated during market-moving moments . . . All of this requires us to be together in the office,” according to the memo.
The company moved into a new headquarters in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards development at the beginning of 2023, bringing employees from its old Midtown office during the first quarter of the year. It signed the lease for the unbuilt 970,000-square-foot space seven years ago.
“We have felt the energy generated by being together, in our larger offices, our newer spaces . . . this energy, and the horizontal collaboration it powers, are what make BlackRock so special,” the memo said.
Employees would be expected to “consistently adhere to the . . . requirements” to be in the office four days a week. Employees would still be able to work remotely for two weeks a year during a “relevant” time period, such as the summer.
BlackRock said: “When fast-moving, high-client-interest events are happening, having our teams physically together to find solutions, seize opportunities and learn from each other makes a difference . . . See you in the office!”

Crypto data project backed by big high-speed traders set to launch,Blockchain,"A crypto project built by some of the world’s largest high-speed traders will launch on Wednesday, the first step its backers see as a “potential game changer” for trading stocks and other assets on blockchain technology.
The Pyth Network has persuaded companies such as Jump Trading, Virtu Financial, GTS, Hudson River Trading and DRW Cumberland to put aside their traditional rivalry and join forces to explore the potential of decentralised finance, or DeFi.
The project, which only began in April, has also drawn in US stock exchanges IEX and MIAX Pearl, currency venue LMAX and crypto derivatives exchange FTX as its momentum grows.
Pyth (rhymes with myth) seeks to change how market data is distributed. Banks and traders have long complained about the data fees charged by exchanges and the legal restrictions they face to redistribute or own data they helped create. David Mercer, chief executive of LMAX said Pyth could “revolutionise and democratise market data provision”.
DeFi offers a chance to build an alternative system, its backers say, because a blockchain guarantees the provenance of an asset and its owner.

The traders and exchanges’ developers have built Pyth to be a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world, known in industry jargon as an “oracle”.
Pyth collects and distributes data on stock, conventional currency, crypto and commodity deals supplied by the high-frequency traders and exchanges and puts it on a blockchain, or distributed ledger. That data can be used in other crypto trading projects.
Pyth anonymises the data and publishes the symbol of the asset, such as Apple or Bitcoin, an aggregate value and a confidence level, which reflects how far Pyth believes the broader market price is from its own prices.
David Olsen, president of Jump Trading, an early supporter of the project, described Pyth as “hugely exciting”. “It remains to be seen how it develops. The wide range of outcomes remains one of the most intriguing developments of Pyth,” he said.
Pyth is built on the Solana blockchain because it can handle 50,000 trades per second, a scale that puts it on a par with Visa, the payments company, and exchanges such as Nasdaq. Most blockchains can only handle a handful of deals per second.
“[Current blockchains] aren’t for trading on but they’re very valuable for valuation purposes. Pyth has the best chance of becoming the capital markets oracle,” Mercer told the Financial Times. “Still, we have to be prepared for it to fail.”
Solana has been backed by venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, and Alameda Research, the cryptocurrency market maker co-founded by FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried.
At present there is no digital token connected with Pyth, and the developers are finalising the governance structure that will mean users decide how it will develop in the future."
Brookfield predicts consolidation in asset management amid downturn,Brookfield Asset Management Inc,"Brookfield Asset Management predicts consolidation in the private capital industry as challenging financial markets force smaller players to find homes inside larger institutions, causing a handful of industry giants to emerge.
“Every industry eventually goes through consolidation . . . [The] alternatives industry is in the midst of this today,” said Bruce Flatt, chief executive of the Toronto-based company, which manages $834bn in assets and is the world’s second-largest alternative asset manager after Blackstone.
“In virtually all sectors, from banking and insurance to consumer products and technology, there are up to 10 industry leading players,” Flatt said in a letter cosigned by Brookfield president Connor Teskey that was published alongside the group’s first-quarter results released on Wednesday.
Brookfield has been one of the biggest buyers in the industry after it took control of credit manager Oaktree Capital Management in 2019. This quarter it paid $174mn to boost its stake in Oaktree to 68 per cent, from 64 per cent.
Flatt’s comments come as a push by traditional asset managers into unlisted investments and efforts by large publicly listed groups, such as Brookfield, to diversify their operations has intensified consolidation in the industry.
Late last year, Brookfield spun off its asset management operations into a publicly listed company, separating it from a broader corporate empire that owns more than $30bn in real estate globally as well as large equity stakes in infrastructure, renewable energy and industrial investment arms that it previously seeded. The manoeuvre boosted its valuation by luring public stock investors and created opportunities for further acquisitions.
Brookfield’s asset management arm generated $547mn in fee-related earnings during the first quarter, an 11 per cent increase from a year ago, ahead of consensus analyst forecasts. These earnings were buoyed by $19bn in new capital it raised during the quarter for funds ranging from private equity to real estate, credit-orientated investments and infrastructure.
The group highlighted heavy new investment from clients in Asia and the Middle East, which underscores a shifting power balance in private capital as gulf states invest a windfall from high oil prices when US and European pension funds manage an overexposure to private assets as they contend with an economic downturn.
“We are currently seeing an increased proportion of our fundraising coming from non-US clients,” said Flatt and Teskey in their letter. They said 40 per cent of the $98bn Brookfield has raised over the past year has come from those regions, marking a new high for the company.
Silicon Valley investors have increased their focus on raising capital from investors in oil-rich states such as Saudi Arabia. Gulf states are also increasingly ploughing their cash into credit-orientated investments to take advantage of rising interest rates.
Brookfield on Wednesday also said it was raising a second “transition” fund focused on decarbonising energy assets such as large utilities, after raising $15bn for its first such fund. The unit, headed by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has already invested 85 per cent of its original fund in large deals such as its $18.7bn takeover of Australian power generator Origin Energy. The fund is preparing to replace Origin’s coal energy generation with renewables over time."
LFS labour’s lost,Bureau of Labor Statistics,"National statistics are like public toilets: you may choose to look closely, but you might not like what you see.
Statisticians go to immense lengths to make sure the data they produce offers, in aggregate, broadly accurate information about countries, economies and population. Modern standards for statistical reproduction are high: processes at bodies like the UK’s Office for National Statistics or the EU’s Eurostat undergo constant, diligent review, both internally and externally.
Sometimes, the best way to do this is by fudging: data has to be smoothed and gaps must be filled. But the smaller your data set, the harder this process is — a pinprick does more damage to a butterfly than to a blue whale.
And data sets are getting smaller. A couple of recent notes have looked at the effect this is having on US labour market surveys. A JPMorgan Asset Management note from March highlighted declining rates of response to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ current employment survey, and Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). Here’s how response rates have shifted for each:
Researcher Stephanie Aliaga wrote (our emphasis):
Along with concerns about whether seasonal adjustments are keeping up with evolving seasonal patterns, the decline in the survey’s response rate raises further questions about the reliability of employment data. Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has undergone increased challenges in conducting its surveys with response rates declining broadly over the last decade, now at just 45% and 31% for the current employment survey (CES) and JOLTS, respectively…
Another issue is the widening difference in responses between the preliminary and final releases, which can lead to large backward revisions. In the establishment survey, response rates for the preliminary release have been declining, but by the time the BLS releases its final estimates, the rate among the active sample improves to an annual average of 94%1. The JOLTS survey is more worrisome, as the response rate for the active sample only improves to 64% from 58% between releases, and both rates have trended downwards significantly. This lower rate combined with a much smaller sample size (21,000 vs. 651,000 establishments in the CES) increases the risk of bias in the JOLTS survey.
Goldman Sachs took its own swing at the topic this week, noting the JOLTS response rate has “plummeted” by nearly a third since the pandemic started, “raising questions about the survey’s reliability at a time when the focus on its monthly prints has never been greater”.
Ronnie Walker et al. write (our emphasis):
— We see two main channels through which a lower response rate can impact the JOLTS job openings statistics. First, a lower response rate reduces the sample size and the accuracy of the resulting statistics. Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median monthly standard error—a measure of the expected discrepancy between a sample estimate and the true value of a population—had already begun increasing before the pandemic. We estimate that the monthly standard error is now at least 90% higher than in 2002-2013. This implies a 90% confidence interval of roughly 700k for the latest readings.
— More importantly, a declining response rate can systematically bias the job vacancy estimates in one direction or the other if the probability of nonresponse is correlated with changes in job openings. And indeed, the BLS cites the increase in remote work as one of the key drivers of nonresponse.
As response rates both dwindle and bifurcate, it’s companies that have adopted flexible working arrangements — which tend to align with lower job openings — that are dropping out of the response cohort and therefore skewing the figures. In this instance, Goldman thinks this is biasing JOLTS higher (that is to say, indicating more openings than there actually are). They write:
It is difficult to accurately estimate the magnitude of the bias without knowing the difference in response rates between companies that are back in the office and those with flexible working arrangements, but our best guess is that JOLTS would have declined an additional 200-300k over the last year absent the bias.
It’s a transatlantic phenomenon. In the UK, the Labour Force Survey (which involves contacting households instead of businesses) has seen a long-running decline in response rates accelerate since the pandemic. Here’s the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics:
Thee longer trend is remarkable: the vast majority of those contacted by the ONS used to respond, now few do (this chart runs up to 2016, so overlap it with the above one in your head):
These issues got beyond the headlines: for instance, response rates in inner London during the latest wave were just 12.8 per cent, versus 20.2 per cent across England.
The Bank of England’s Swati Dhingra flagged the potential problems at a Resolution Foundation event earlier this year:
There is an element of judgement doing in here, there’s an element also of data fog… of, for example, response rates in the Labour Force Survey have fallen to the levels that they have, how reliable is that and how much we can be certain about what we’re picking up from there is, in fact, really data?
She referred to “years gone by when data was better, it was better quality”.
Eurostat’s figures aren’t as easy to uncover as the ONS’s, and its press officers said they don’t track aggregate non-response data as a time series. But its latest quality report for the EU LFS (covering 2020) at least points to some of the issues that can occur.
For instance, every year a handful of countries don’t get responses to certain questions:
In aggregate, Eurostat identified issues of under-coverage — when parts of the target population surveyors had hoped to reach — in almost half the countries it looked at. Non-respondence (when the would-be respondent doesn’t give an answer to any or all of the question) is an issue, per the report, but for varying reasons:
In most countries, non-response was due to the impossibility to contact the sampling unit or the respondent. By contrast, in Czechia, Estonia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and the North Macedonia, most of the non-respondents refused to participate in the EU-LFS. In Belgium and Austria, non-response was mainly due to other reasons, as lost interviews due to technical issues, expired time for completing an interrupted interview, etc.
Eurostat isn’t even sure how much is being fudged. The report says twenty countries “adopted editing and correction procedures to EU-LFS data” in 2020… but adds “for most countries, the overall editing rate remains unclear”, rending it unable to estimate the degree of overall processing errors.
As ever, the annexes are full of thought-provoking delights. For instance, here’s Ireland’s notes on a compulsory question about how why respondents have a temporary job:
Not stated answers arise from respondents. Non-response is rising fast. Any other reason behind it?
Or Croatia, on income deciles:
People do not want to give an answer on this sensitive issue especially in the case of proxy interview.
But without broad data on respondence overall, it’s hard to know whether Europe’s problems are on the same scale as the US and UK’s. The UN’s International Labour Organization, while designs labour force surveys, told us it doesn’t track national nonresponse levels.
What does it all subtract down to? On the US’s response woes, Aliaga writes:
In general, these concerns remind us that the government’s monthly jobs report should be seen as just one piece of the broader labor market mosaic.
Might a similar downgrade to also-ran status be awaiting some other statistical heavyweights?

CME plays down rival to LME nickel market,CME Group Inc,"CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, said it is not planning to launch a nickel contract to rival the London Metal Exchange, despite its chief describing the LME as having “a lot of issues”.
“I’m not working on listing a nickel contract,” Terry Duffy, chair and chief executive of the Chicago-based group, told the Financial Times, adding “never say never” but that launching an alternative would be difficult.
Users have called for an urgent overhaul of the LME’s nickel market after the 146-year old British exchange sparked deep controversy last year by cancelling eight hours’ of trades when prices surged in a short squeeze. The decision has drawn lawsuits from customers including hedge funds and market makers, and led to regulatory investigations.
Adding to its problems, last month the exchange found bags of rocks at a warehouse instead of the nickel they were meant to contain. Duffy said that discovery shows “there’s something really violently broken there”.
Last month the head of trading group Trafigura added to pressure on the London exchange, saying its nickel contract is not fit for purpose.
Some investors have hoped the CME would launch a rival contract as it already trades aluminium, copper and steel.
But Duffy pointed out that there were obstacles to overcome such as the storage and delivery of the physical metal.
In order to create a new contract, “you need the guys who have warehouses . . . you need to add value to shareholders”, said Duffy, who has worked at CME for more than two decades, having been a member on the old trading floor. “I don’t want to get my team in there and say we can wrestle away liquidity. Liquidity becomes very hard to displace and I still believe that with LME.”
LME is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and Duffy doubted it was open to selling. “I’m rooting for them to get it right because it only helps the entire system,” he added.
CME has grown to become the world’s largest futures and options exchange and was one of the first venues to trade crypto derivatives.
Duffy, who has been a vocal opponent of failed crypto exchange FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, said that while traders have made money from crypto, there are few tangible use cases aside from stablecoins which help “eliminate friction”.
“Industries are not using [crypto] to create efficiencies for their businesses . . . economies aren’t benefiting, I don’t see that one bit,” he added."
Calpers signals ‘appetite’ to increase bets on private equity,California Public Employees' Retirement System,"Calpers, the biggest US public pension plan, is considering bigger bets on private equity despite growing fears that higher interest rates will curb the industry’s returns.
Chief executive Marcie Frost said that the $442bn-in-assets retirement fund, one of the world’s biggest investors in private equity, will start an extensive review of its holdings in this sector next month, adding that there is “appetite” to increase its allocation.
The review of Calpers’ $52bn private equity portfolio will take place nearly nine months after Nicole Musicco, who started as chief investment officer last year, said a decision to put the pension plan’s private equity programme on hold for a decade between 2009 and 2018 had cost it up to $18bn of returns.
“If we [the Calpers board] had conviction that we could put more money into private equity, the appetite is there to do it from an investor perspective [and] from the investment office’s perspective,” Frost told the Financial Times. “That’ll be part of the asset allocation review.”
Frost’s comments come as many investors worry about returns from the private equity industry, which has sucked in trillions of dollars of assets over the past decade.
The sector is now facing much higher debt financing costs, a deteriorating global economic outlook and concerns about the potential for “stale” valuations lagging those of public markets. Last year the chief investment officer at Danish pension fund ATP compared the private equity industry to a pyramid scheme.
Frost said that there was “a lot of debate” about private equity valuations, but believed the methods used to value Calpers’ portfolio were sound and the fact that private equity valuations were generally only reviewed every quarter was not a major issue for the fund.
“I don’t believe that there’s a problem with the quarter lag on the valuation, it really comes down to the processes that are used [for the valuation],” she said. “Our processes are quite sound . . . we have those done by outside entities.”
Despite the challenges buyouts firms are facing, some investors are increasing their bets on the asset class in a bid to profit from cheaper valuations. Some of the best performing private equity returns were generated in the wake of the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis, according to PitchBook data.
At the start of the 2022/23 financial year, Calpers increased its target allocation for private equity from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. This could rise further if the review gives the green light. Calpers is keen to make new investments into private equity directly, rather than using external managers.
Frost also said the fund is “seeing more deal flow opportunities” in private debt following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders, and that the fund was ready to take more risk to profit from such positions.
“Based on current tightening in the banking industry, there are opportunities that we could pursue,” she said.
“We are in a place where we have liquidity, we have a lot of dry powder that we can put to use,” she added. “So we think that as long as we have the appropriate underwriting, this is an opportunity even in a distressed environment.”
Her comments come after a turbulent period for the banking sector, with Signature Bank and First Republic in the US also both collapsing and ailing Swiss lender Credit Suisse being taken over by rival UBS.
The Federal Reserve this month warned of a “sharp contraction” in credit. Big private capital firms such as Blackstone, Apollo Global and KKR have been exploring ways to increase their exposure to private credit.
Frost said the fund was prepared for the extra risk that private debt investing could involve.
“You’re not going to get the returns of 6.8 per cent [the scheme’s annual target] long term without taking on some risk,” she said.

An important update on Icahn’s perpetual dividend . . .,Carl Icahn,"For only the 50th time since starting coverage in 2013, Jefferies is advising clients to buy shares in Icahn Enterprises.
You’ll probably know Icahn from recent press coverage. There was a short-seller report that accused Carl Icahn’s activist fund of using “Ponzi-like economic structures”, followed closely by a federal prosecutors’ inquiry and a colourful rebuttal. The shares are down 36 per cent in the month to date, which has cut Icahn’s net worth by approximately $7bn and amused a lot of people.
But you’ll not spot any of this in Jefferies’ latest “buy” note, which is a masterpiece of elephant disregarding. Here’s the executive summary:
IEP reported a 1Q23 net loss attributable to IEP of -$270M compared to $323M in 4Q21. Adjusted EBITDA in the period equaled +$116M driven by strong energy segment EBITDA offset by investment fund losses. The investment fund generated negative returns of -4.1% in the qtr as long positions were up +1.3%, offset by losses in short positions of -6.2%. Importantly, IEP declared a $2.00/ share qtrly dividend.
To remind, Jefferies has long been Icahn’s go-to bank when he was planning LBOs, trading stocks and raising money. It’s also the only sellside house to publish research on Icahn, which for the past decade has been an unbroken streak of “buy” recommendations.
The short-seller report from Hindenburg calls shenanigans here, alleging that Jefferies was using its research as retail investor bait. In Hindenburg’s view, Jefferies had been telling clients that Icahn’s dividend would be safe “into perpetuity”, no matter what, while also arranging the share sales it says are needed to fund said dividend.
Turns out nothing lasts forever, however:
Our revised PT [to $43.00 from $70.00] reflects lower cash flows from the underlying business units vs previous forecasts as segments like auto, real estate and home fashion remain under pressure. While parent liquidity to support the current $8/annual dividend remains plentiful ($6.6B available liquidity, of which $1.9B is cash and cash equivalents), we are now assuming the current dividend begins to decline by 10% per annum beginning in 2026 vs maintenance of the current rate in our previous dividend discount model.
Jefferies continues to forecast in all possible scenarios that Icahn will pay $8 per share in dividends annually until 2025. From 2026 there’s 10 per cent attrition in the base case, on a range of 5 per cent to 50 per cent . . .
... though its earnings forecast tables only go out to 2024, so it’s impossible to see exactly what’s expected to go wrong with auto, real estate and home fashion in three years time.
Confidence in the long-term predictions may not be aided by Jefferies’ accuracy in the quarter just passed, in which the poor performance of Icahn’s hedge fund and the bankruptcy of Auto Plus appear to have either been overlooked or underestimated. Analyst Dan Fannon&nbsp;had expected Icahn to post Q1 earnings per share of $0.19; it posted an EPS loss of $0.79.
Rippling that sizeable miss through the spreadsheet means that, even after bumping up the coming quarters by a dime or two, the 2023 EPS forecast is cut by 85 per cent. This is of course a consensus expectation, based on a survey of one:
And just in case it needs reiterating:

Icahn says he made a mistake&nbsp;
An early victory for AT1 bondholders&nbsp;
Geely takes Aston Martin for a spin
The age of cheap money was supposed to be a time of easy profits for investors, but for one of Wall Street’s titans it spurred an epic string of losses.&nbsp;
Carl Icahn, the billionaire known for his activist battles with corporate giants like Texaco, Dell and Apple, has lost money every year since 2014, mostly by building costly hedges against a fast-rising market to protect his investment empire from a 2008-like collapse.
Since the beginning of 2017, Icahn has lost nearly $9bn due to large hedges he built as he grew increasingly sceptical of valuations and the health of the global economy, a decision Icahn told DD’s Antoine Gara and Ortenca Aliaj was a mistake.&nbsp;
“I’ve always told people there is nobody who can really pick the market on a short-term or an intermediate-term basis,” Icahn said in an interview to discuss the Financial Times’ analysis of his losses. “Maybe I made the mistake of not adhering to my own advice in recent years.”
According to an FT analysis, the prominent activist investor lost about $1.8bn in 2017 on hedging positions that would’ve paid out if asset prices had tumbled before losing a further $7bn between 2018 and the first quarter of this year.
Icahn started aggressively betting on a market collapse in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and became increasingly bolder in subsequent years, deploying a complex strategy that involved shorting broad market indices, individual companies, commercial mortgages and debt securities.
At times, Icahn’s notional exposure, the underlying value of the securities he was betting against, exceeded $15bn, regulatory filings show. “You never get the perfect hedge, but if I kept the parameters I always believed in . . . I would have been fine,” he said. “But I didn’t.”
The bearish trades neutralised about $6bn in gains from his activist wagers, leaving him with an overall investment loss of nearly $3bn since 2017 and the publicly listed vehicle he controls, Icahn Enterprises, in a vulnerable position.
Earlier this month, short seller Hindenburg Research released a report criticising the finances of the vehicle, which is owned mostly by Icahn. It drew attention to large-margin loans Icahn had taken against his shares.
Icahn told the FT that he had used the loans to make additional investments and had billions of dollars of cash outside of his public vehicle.&nbsp;
“Over the years I have made a great deal of money with money. I like to have a war chest and doing that gave me more of a war chest,” he added, referring to the margin loan.
As pressure on his firm mounts, Icahn has been forced to rein in his short bets just as some investors fear that a regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling stand-off could result in a sharp market sell-off.
It is bad enough discovering that the regulator has entirely wiped out your investment. But it is truly awful when it then tries to keep its rationale for doing so a secret.
This was the situation facing Credit Suisse’s additional tier 1 bondholders, who lost $17bn when Swiss financial regulator Finma ordered the bank to write down the bonds as a condition of its shotgun wedding to UBS.
While Finma initially refused to disclose its decree ordering the writedown to AT1 investors (we guess bank secrecy is still a bit of a thing in Switzerland), a group that is suing the regulator has now managed to force it to hand over the document.&nbsp;
Inside are both highly technical (but important) justifications for the writedown alongside juicy details relating to the dire shape Credit Suisse found itself in the days before the UBS merger.
Obtaining the document presents an early victory for the holders of at least $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bonds who are suing Finma. But the wider legal battle is still expected to be protracted and final victory is very much not assured.
Still, when you’re fighting to overturn a decree, it helps to know what it actually says. No one likes battling in the dark.&nbsp;
After years of pursuit, Geely has finally caught Aston Martin.
Over years of patient stakebuilding, the Chinese car group has built a sprawling empire that covers investments in Mercedes-Benz, Lotus and Polestar. But the greatest prize has always been the British luxury brand.
During an appearance at the FT’s Future of the Car summit last week, Geely’s chief executive Daniel Li said he “loved” the Aston Martin brand. When asked if it would raise its stake, he coyly replied: “We don’t have anything ready for an announcement.”
Seven days later, the announcement was ready. Thursday’s deal sees it more-than double its stake to 17 per cent through new shares and some of chair Lawrence Stroll’s holding, with an agreement not to go above 22 per cent before August 2024.
Geely isn’t in control, yet. It is still in third place in the investor deck to Stroll’s private band of investors, and to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is itself an investor in McLaren and electric vehicle start-up Lucid.
But the company has a board seat and a “long-term partnership” to explore selling Aston Martin technologies and components from across its group.
Geely bid for the company several times, most notably in late 2019, when the group presented a rival offer to Stroll’s.
The big question for Aston Martin is whether Geely’s larger presence presents a future off-ramp for Stroll, whose investments have cratered as he tries to repair the brand’s “ultra-luxury” credentials. Stroll has consistently said he’ll stay invested in Aston Martin for the long run.
But, as long as he can keep his son Lance racing in Formula 1 with Aston Martin as part of an agreement to sell the company, speculation will mount that he wouldn’t refuse a dignified transition.
The Chinese group’s long-term plans shouldn’t be underestimated.
The best way to understand Geely is through the words of former Volvo Cars boss Hakan Samuelsson, who was asked whether the company wanted to become China’s answer to Volkswagen.
“Oh no,” he replied. “They’re far more ambitious than that.”

Silvergate Capital Corporation is the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank, which we believe is the leading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services to participants in the nascent and expanding digital currency industry. As a result of this leadership position, the majority of our funding comes from noninterest bearing deposits associated with clients in the digital currency industry.
This unique source of funding is a distinctive advantage over most traditional financial institutions and allows us to generate revenue from a conservative portfolio of investments in cash, short term securities and certain types of loans that we believe generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, we believe that fee income may represent a valuable source of additional future revenue as we develop and deploy fee-based solutions in connection with our digital currency initiative.

Shares in Chinese state enterprises jump as investors seek high dividend yield,Chinese equities,"Investors are ploughing money into shares of China’s state-run enterprises as they seek a haven from weakness in the Chinese economy and better returns than those offered by the country’s government bond market.
Since the start of April, shares in government-run banks have rocketed with state lenders Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China up more than 20 and 10 per cent respectively, in a rare rally for the country’s bank shares.
More generally, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Red Chips index of state-run enterprises has climbed about 10 per cent this year compared with a slight loss for the broader Hang Seng China Enterprises index.
The rally in SOE stocks reflects a hunt for higher dividend yield, analysts said, as a range of China-focused investors lose their appetite for government bond yields that have been driven sharply lower by investors’ flight to safety in the face of economic uncertainty.
“Funds that chase after absolute returns are hunting for stocks with high dividend yield,” said Wang Xin, an analyst with Guosen Securities. Wang added that the recent gains had been fuelled by buying from a wide range of investors, including local punters, foreign investors, insurers and even the banks’ own investment funds.
The shift into bank stocks reflects investors’ appetite for steady and low-risk returns on investment, which is now more easily satisfied by dividend payments from state stocks than Chinese sovereign bonds.
Where easing measures have pushed yields on 10-year Chinese government debt below 3 per cent, the country’s biggest banks, which as pillars of China’s financial system enjoy substantial state support, are expected to pay out yearly dividends of about 6 to 7 per cent, according to estimates from Macquarie Group.
Dexter Hsu, an analyst with Macquarie, said support from Beijing helped ensure steady and relatively high dividend payments by state banks, allowing them to outperform renminbi bond yields while providing investors with a safer play than private companies.
Wang Qi, chief executive at fund manager MegaTrust Investment in Hong Kong, said SOEs had also become “prime candidates for trading” thanks to a years-long deleveraging campaign by Beijing that had helped make their balance sheets healthier.
Top officials have also been talking up the valuations in the state sector. China Securities Regulatory Commission chair Yi Huiman last year used a high-profile speech to introduce the phrase “valuation system with Chinese characteristics” that has since become a popular term in the industry when analysing the recent surge in value of SOE stocks. Yi also singled out SOEs and state-run financial groups for their “role as pillars of the economy”.
“There aren’t any specific policies there beyond the slogan,” said MegaTrust’s Wang. These stocks have typically lagged behind the market and “the leading SOEs have been directed by the government to find ways to increase their stock valuation — or at least narrow their valuation discount”.
But while the state sector has found renewed favour, especially among China’s many retail investors, analysts said private sector stocks were more likely to outperform if the economy found its footing.
“We indeed see the government wanting to push valuations higher for SOEs,” said Liu Minyue, investment specialist for Asian and global emerging markets equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “But this looks more like a short-term trend for share prices. In the longer term, private companies will still have to be the primary drivers of China’s growth.”"
Bank of England orders Euroclear to bolster resilience after 2020 outage,Clearing & Settlement,"The Bank of England has ordered Euroclear to improve its technology and operational resilience after a blockage last year in a crucial portion of the plumbing that underlies markets scuppered a planned gilt purchase auction.
The central bank on Friday launched a supervisory action against the Belgian company’s UK and Ireland arm, which runs London’s main utility for settling bond and equity deals, following an extensive IT glitch in September last year.
Euroclear suffered a two-day outage of its Crest system, which has a critical function in the running of markets by settling trades on behalf of investors and transferring money between the central bank and commercial banks.
A problem with its messaging software meant Crest — which settled 80.4m trades last year with a value of more than £360tn — was unable to clear a backlog of trades. It forced the BoE to temporarily halt purchases of government bonds as part of its quantitative easing programme, intended to help boost the UK economy during the pandemic.
It was the first time that Crest had to use a back-up system to settle deals at the end of the day, requiring the Bank of England step in to ensure trades were completed and parties not left exposed.
Euroclear has previously described the outage as “highly unusual”. It subsequently commissioned an independent review led by consultancy Duff &amp; Phelps, but the scope was widened after a second technical issue in November.
The outages happened as Euroclear was finalising its application to operate under new tougher rules for settlement houses and was spending on IT to meet the requirements. The BoE nevertheless approved Euroclear’s application in December.
Both the BoE and Euroclear declined to elaborate on the recommendations in the independent report, and the BoE added that the move did not imply Euroclear had breached regulatory requirements or constitute enforcement action.
However, Euroclear conceded in its 2020 annual report that it had not met its own performance standards on service resilience and system availability.
It also said it would review its business and IT strategy this year to further improve its operational resilience, and embed processes that would ensure it continued to comply with the new settlement regulations.
In a statement, Euroclear said it was “fully committed to implementing these changes and in fact a number of the recommendations have already been executed”. It had kept the regulator, clients and stakeholders informed of the review process, it added.
The BoE said it would formally require the company to implement the changes and would appoint a so-called “skilled person” to oversee them. The appointee will give the bank a report in the first half of next year, to give it assurances the changes have been made."
EU under pressure to extend access to London clearing houses,Clearing & Settlement,"The EU is coming under mounting pressure from Europe’s biggest derivatives houses to radically rethink its plans for wresting euro-denominated clearing from the City of London.
Clearing houses — which reduce market risk by standing between two parties in a trade — have been a key battleground since Brexit, with the EU intent on moving the clearing of strategically important European trades to the continent as soon as it is practical to do so.
The latest deadline, which the EU has vowed will be the final cut-off, is June 2025. But finance bosses have warned of the grave risk to financial stability which Brussels’ blueprint poses.
Europe’s biggest derivatives houses, including BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale, vehemently oppose the EU’s plans, fearing extra costs and less efficient clearing, while London’s clearing house LCH, which stands to lose lucrative business, has also pushed for a rethink.
Banks, LCH and their lobby groups stepped up efforts to overturn the European Commission’s plans in recent weeks, warning that Brussels’ proposals to bring the activity onshore are not workable and could wreak havoc with European markets.
“Officials are involved at the highest levels on both sides as this is a financial stability issue for the EU/eurozone and it is also an existential issue for the City,” said one person involved in the talks, who asked not to be named as discussions were sensitive.
Lobbying led by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association is focused on the detail of the EU’s plans to force companies to route a yet-to-be determined percentage of certain euro-denominated trades through EU clearing houses from mid-2025.
ISDA said the proposals as they stood were so unworkable they could “have the undesired outcome of dissuading market participants from clearing transactions” which would increase risk in markets.
Lobby group the European Banking Federation has circulated a position paper in recent weeks, warning MEPs and EU member states that Europe’s current plans “may lead to unforeseen and extensively adverse effects on the competitiveness, resilience and attractiveness of European financial markets and their financial institutions”.
Clearing is the only area where the EU has granted London temporary “equivalence” in the aftermath of Brexit, allowing the City’s clearing powerhouse to continue handling euro denominated swaps trades that stood at €133tn as of Friday’s close.
Extending equivalence further is politically fraught. The EU’s financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness has insisted June 2025 is the final cut off.
But serious doubts have emerged about the practicalities of implementing the plan, unveiled last December, and concerns about financial stability have shot up the global political agenda after the implosion of a clutch of US banks and the collapse of Credit Suisse.
People familiar with the EU’s position said Brussels was not entertaining an extension now and that any changes would fall to the next commission, which takes over in late 2024.
The commission said its decision last February to extend equivalence for UK clearing houses “ensures the EU’s financial stability in the short-term. There are currently no plans to amend this decision.”
“There is an inconsistency between the message at political level and the reality on the ground,” another person involved in the industry discussions told the Financial Times. “We almost take it as a given that equivalence will be extended.”
Some EU officials said the extension could be an early reward for improved relations between the two sides after the Windsor framework, overseen by UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, settled the thorny issue of trade between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit.
“If I were Rishi Sunak, I would be pushing very hard for this,” said one EU official. “There isn’t anything concrete, but the atmosphere is very positive.”
British officials also suspect the EU might extend the 2025 date, but primarily because the bloc’s financial services sector needs London and is anxious to avoid massive dislocation.
“There could be a lot of game-playing about who is the real winner in all of this,” said one British government official, arguing it might be in the EU’s interests to suggest it was doing the UK a favour. “But we have not held any discussions on this.”
LCH declined to comment on any specific talks but said: “We will continue to engage and co-operate with the relevant regulatory authorities in respect of the long-term recognition of LCH Limited on an ongoing basis.”&nbsp;
Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Société Générale declined to comment.
McGuinness is expected to visit London this month and will discuss, among other things, a new memorandum of understanding on financial services, intended to create a talking shop to resolve differences between the two sides.
Research from Acuiti, a derivatives market information supplier, on Thursday found that 8 per cent of market participants supported the EU’s clearing plans and the majority worried it would raise their costs. Most wanted clarity from the EU on its plans, it added.
“There does need to be clarity as you can’t get clearing membership in a few months,” said William Mitting, chief executive of Acuiti. “There’s a lot of investment and it’s a long process.”"
Euronext breaks LSE deal to move clearing functions to Italy,Clearing & Settlement,"Euronext is breaking a deal with a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group to shift clearing functions to Italy, in a move that further reduces the role of UK-based institutions in pivotal areas of Europe’s financial markets.
Euronext, the biggest stock markets operator in the EU, said on Monday it was giving notice to LCH in Paris, which is owned by the LSE, to terminate a 10-year deal early and begin moving its equity, derivatives and commodities business to Italy.
Its move has underscored the extent to which Euronext has leveraged its €4.4bn acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the LSE earlier this year to tilt its operations to the EU and away from London.
Euronext announced plans in April to move its trading servers from an Essex data centre owned by ICE Futures Europe to a new site at Bergamo in Italy. The first moves will begin from the middle of next year.
The LCH and Euronext deal on clearing was due to expire in 2027, but the purchase of Borsa Italiana included the CC&amp;G clearing house in Milan, which meant that Euronext no longer had to rely on services from its rival.
Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, said the “transforming” deal had been key. “When you get bigger it allows you [to] do things in a different manner and to expand your business. Our ambitions on clearing and the data centre are a direct consequence of us now owning this type of assets,” he said.
A clearing house stands between two parties in financial transactions, helping to avoid fallout across markets should an entity default. It is a back-office function dominated by London. But it has become highly politicised in Europe after the UK voted to leave the EU.
Authorities see regulatory control over clearing houses as a crucial element in controlling systemic risk for the financial system. Euronext had tried to buy the French unit, valued at €510m, in 2017 when the LSE was looking to merge with Deutsche Börse but the deal fell through when the merger collapsed. Market participants say the continent is not ready to host clearing itself.
The derivatives business would move in 2024 after the notice period expired at the end of 2023, Euronext said. The cash equities business could serve notice right away, Boujnah said. CC&amp;G would be folded into a bigger unit called Euronext Clearing, the exchange added. The LSE said the cash equities business was subject to a 12-month notice period.
“The total potential impact is less than 1 per cent of total group revenue and is not at risk for a number of years,” the LSE said in a statement.
The move meant Euronext increased its forecast for pre-tax synergies from the deal by 67 per cent to €100m; however, it also raised its prediction on restructuring costs, from €100m to €160m. Half of the new total would be in operating costs and the rest in exceptional costs, it said.
Boujnah also suggested to the European Commission that the EU executive use Euronext’s MTS government debt platform, part of Borsa Italiana, for trading of the bonds issued under the Next Generation EU recovery programme."
Can biodiversity funds help investors protect wildlife?,Climate change,"If you’re an investor who cares about climate change, you probably already own a sustainable fund. Perhaps it focuses on renewable energy, or maybe it looks at the circular economy or electric vehicles.
Investors have been aware of these issues for a while, of course, and the sustainable fund market has exploded to the point where regulators are intervening to sort out what is green and what is not.
But there is a new hot topic in sustainability, often referred to as the other side of the climate change coin: biodiversity.
Around a million species are threatened with extinction (we only know of 1.5mn, though there are probably millions more), many within decades, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ipbes). As of 2018, species population sizes had fallen 69 per cent on average since just 1970, according to the WWF’s living planet index.
The main culprit is not climate change, though it is a big one, but changes in land and sea use, particularly deforestation. Pollution, including farming pesticides and plastic in the oceans, is another driver, while invasive alien species have contributed to nearly 40 per cent of all animal extinctions since the 17th century, including the native birds of the Pacific island of Guam, which disappeared after the introduction of the brown tree snake.
A UN conference in December (confusingly labelled COP15 but separate from the better-known COP26 climate conference in that it focused on biodiversity) agreed to certain goals by 2030, including halving food waste, cutting government subsidies that encourage biodiversity loss and widening protection for particularly biodiverse areas.
The fund management industry has taken note. A wave of biodiversity funds has sprung up in the past year to supposedly address this issue. Morningstar, the data provider, counts 19 such funds — many of which are less than a year old, with no meaningful performance data as yet.
But with the sector in its infancy, fund managers have not yet agreed on how to measure biodiversity. One problem is that there is not much hard data on biodiversity that can be used to select stocks.
Alix Chosson, an ESG analyst at Candriam, says a lack of regulation and agreement on the right metrics can make it difficult to integrate biodiversity in corporate strategies. “COP15 brought some general commitment and good intentions but nowhere near what COP21 brought to climate,” she says. While climate change has carbon emissions as a metric, biodiversity is a broader issue and can include species, soil and water, to name just a few.
Some analysts use a metric called ‘mean species abundance’, or MSA, which attempts to measure what the actual biodiversity levels are as a result of a company’s activities versus what they should have been. Taken crudely, this approach could mean that funds just invest in sectors that never had much of an MSA impact in the first place: tech stocks, for example, or offices.
The Euronext ESG Eurozone biodiversity leaders PAB index, for example, uses MSA as one of its tools in selecting companies for the index. The result: top 10 holdings dominated by tech and consumer stocks, including Michelin, Unilever, Pernod Ricard and the Kering luxury group.
Tom Atkinson, who manages Axa’s Biodiversity fund, has one alternative way of using the existing metrics: he says a bad MSA score can be an opportunity to engage with that company — engagement being an important tool up sustainable investors’ sleeves. For example, his team has engaged with a paper and packaging company that uses a lot of land and has therefore a lot of scope for improvement.
In general, he says his fund tries to take a “purist” approach and doesn’t address climate change as such as they assume investors already have that exposure in other funds. It focuses on four areas: water, agriculture, recycling and recirculation and sustainable materials, and targets solutions providers rather than mega-caps making biodiversity promises.
To be included in the fund, a company has to have at least 20 per cent of its revenue coming from a product or service that specifically addresses biodiversity — which leads to companies such as Unilever, for example, being excluded. That also gives the fund a mid-cap bias. The fund has in its top holdings agriculture business Deere, water company Xylem, and Darling Ingredients.
Some biodiversity funds try to take a mix and match approach. Fidelity’s sustainable biodiversity fund — launched in September and still tiny at just $5mn — has 75-80 per cent of its holdings in what manager Velislava Dimitrova calls solutions. These include Bioceres, which focuses on crop productivity and helping the farming industry become carbon neutral, Corteva, which offers pest control solutions to farmers that are better for biodiversity, and Bakkafrost, which farms salmon in a low-carbon way.
The remainder of its holdings are in so-called “best in class” companies — those that are doing better on addressing biodiversity than their peers, even if they’re not in the business of providing specific solutions. Danone and L’Oréal find their way into the top 10 holdings on the basis that they have made commitments to improve their biodiversity footprint. Having best in class companies is also a way for biodiversity funds to spread their risk: firms that are coming up with positive solutions will probably be smaller and riskier than larger cap, defensive stocks.
Other funds are comfortable taking a longer term view at the expense of significant short pain. Edward Lees, co-manager of the BNP Paribas Ecosystem Restoration fund, is critical of funds that are focused on best in class companies. “We can’t afford to just look at these indirect stories. We’ve got to get a move on,” he says. His fund has various holdings in food and agriculture, from Darling Ingredients to Oatly to Salmon Evolution.
But direct focus can come at a price when the global economy is struggling. With solutions to biodiversity still at a relatively early stage, companies focused on this area tend to be mid cap at best and are going for growth, rather than providing steady dividends. The past year, with rising interest rates and inflation, has been tough for them. The case for them is clearly long term, with regulation and investor interest likely to increase, while fund managers argue the derating makes it a good time to buy.
The BNP Paribas fund, for example, has lost nearly 40 per cent in the past year. Lees says that while they remain committed to integrity, they are moving up the market cap curve a little bit in light of the current economic conditions.
With World Biodiversity Day on Monday intended to raise awareness, it’s a good time for retail investors to consider putting these funds in their portfolio alongside existing climate change holdings. And professional investors need to push companies to disclose more about their biodiversity impact, so that better metrics can be developed.
With an uncertain economic outlook, investors could see the recent valuation losses extended for a while, as the mid-cap companies at the forefront of change can be volatile. So these stocks won’t suit everyone. But, longer term, the sector is likely to grow.

Funding is key to helping polluters go green,Climate change,"As more countries and corporations declare their net zero commitments, they pose an immediate, practical question: is capital flowing in the right direction to help their pledges be met?
While investment in green assets and technologies has grown, their popularity offers only part of the solution and raises new, complex problems. At the same time, if turning “brown” companies into green ones is intuitively beneficial, the financing of such a transition is far from straightforward.
Spiralling demand for minerals such as lithium, for example, is indicative of a cleaner automotive industry as the material is integral to batteries powering electric cars. But it is also a cause of concern because of the environmental impact of its mining.
Extracting lithium from the ground involves displacing vast amounts of groundwater and the risk of contributing to desertification. In 2050, the World Bank estimates that demand for the mineral will have grown to nearly five times the levels of production seen in 2018.
Other raw materials essential for electric vehicles and renewable energy technology pose further quandaries. Cobalt, for example, is mostly produced in the DRC in hazardous conditions involving child labour, as campaign organisations have long warned. And this is something investors are well aware of, too.
“If you’ve ever seen a lithium mine or a cobalt mine, they’re not the most environmentally friendly — not to mention the social aspects around them,” notes Robert Furdak, chief investment officer for environmental, social and governance (ESG) at Man Group. “ESG aspects are oftentimes very nuanced, and you just have to understand the complications of some of these issues.”
While technology is improving — electric automaker Tesla is working on cobalt-free batteries — evaluating the overall impact of investments is tricky. In addition, there are other factors that can make directing capital towards climate goals even trickier.
While financing for green assets is abundant, financing the green transformation of heavy emitters is rather more arduous. Arguably, this is most evident in a jurisdiction such as the EU, which has created a green taxonomy setting clear boundaries between the “colours” of different companies but not guided on what is permissible, or even encouraged, in the transition from brown to green.
This tension is exemplified by the still tentative market of transition bonds, intended to finance the process. “Every time a client wants to issue a transition bond, they fear that [this will attract] a reputational risk,” says Hacina Py, head of impact finance solutions at Société Générale. “What is brown, according to the EU, is what is never going to become green but, in the middle, there is not enough space.”
The European Commission’s director-general for climate action, Mauro Petriccione, admits that the EU could do “a little better” in clarifying its position and expectations regarding the energy sources needed in the transition to a greener economy. He says natural gas is essential in the short term, but that by 2050 it should be out of the system entirely.
Speaking at a recent Financial Times conference, Petriccione added that, “there are financial institutions that have taken the bull by the horns and gone ahead [with transition financing] and I don’t think they have suffered [as a consequence].”
Though numbers remain low — $4.5bn this year, according to data provider Refinitiv — there are signs that transition bonds are set to grow. In February, the London Stock Exchange created a transition bond segment on its venue, expecting rising activity.
Italian energy infrastructure company Snam has already tapped the market four times during 2020 and 2021, for a total of €2.35bn to help finance its 2040 net zero goals. And the supply of green bonds is still relatively low compared with demand, leaving ESG investors looking for more — the EU’s debut green bond, to raise the groundbreaking sum of €12bn, was 11 times subscribed.
Outside the EU, Dean Alborough, head of ESG at Old Mutual Alternatives, wishes regulators would encourage transition finance so that corporates, as well as multilateral banks, may feel inspired to tap the market. “If there’s a regulation that allows for this transition, development finance and private sector finance will be protected from a reputational perspective,” he says.
Some estimate low-carbon technologies will require over $90tn of investment over the next 15 years. Meanwhile, the financing of fossil fuel production is attracting more controversy. Many argue that green technology and infrastructure do not yet allow for the abandonment of this industry.
“There is still a lot of ground to [cover to] define exactly what transition is, and how you apply it in different sectors,” says Demetrio Salorio, UK head of global banking and advisory at Société Générale. But he adds: “We cannot abandon the financing of oil and gas today, it would be impossible.”

Greetings from New York. I have just returned from Boston, where the mighty Harvard University has been staging its inaugural Climate Action Week in recent days. As Jeremy Grantham, the investment luminary who has long shouted (or thundered) about the risks of climate change, observed in a panel that I moderated, Harvard has been lamentably slow to embrace these issues. But the Salata family, which has been wildly successful in private capital, has now funded the creation of a brand new climate centre, and a number of other big, deep-pocketed Harvard alumni, such as investor John Fisher, have chipped in too.
The creation of the university’s cross departmental Climate Action Week is no mean feat, given that Harvard is so prone to tribalism between departmental silos. And the institution is such a big brand name that the event highlights a bigger point about the current zeitgeist in corporate America: irrespective of the rightwing backlash against environmental, social and governance issues, incumbent companies, start-ups and investors alike are increasingly focused on climate today. This is particularly true since the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act which is creating rich opportunities in green energy.
A report below, from the Lazard investment bank, echoes this point: US climate disclosures are also rising, even as company directors are now engaged in “green-hushing” (ie they avoid talking about ESG out of fear of the political risks). However, the picture is patchy: check out our report below on the conflicts that some corporate directors are quietly juggling in this respect. And, as ever, let us know what you think. (Gillian Tett)
As investors at shareholder meetings in recent weeks scrutinised bank directors’ abilities to manage risk and deliver returns, one striking fact may have gone unnoticed.
Non-executive directors at some of the world’s biggest financial institutions also have top roles at oil and gas or power companies, according to data compiled by the investigative website DeSmog and analysed by Moral Money.
Take Bank of America. Denise L Ramos, a director on its sustainability committee, has a surprising side gig: chair of the public policy and sustainability committee at Texan oil refiner Phillips 66. The refiner was among the 20 most obstructive companies on climate change last year, according to InfluenceMap’s lobbying record analysis. The bank declined to comment.
A few other examples stand out. Adebayo Ogunlesi — the chair of Goldman Sachs’s governance committee, which helps manage the bank’s exposure to climate change — is also head of the committee that oversees pay at Kosmos Energy, a Texan deepwater oil exploration company. His colleague Jessica Uhl, a director on Goldman Sachs’s audit, risk and governance committees, worked at Shell for nearly two decades — including as chief financial officer — before joining the bank last year.&nbsp;
Wells Fargo director Theodore F Craver Jr, former boss of the utility Edison International, is also chair of the governance committee at US power company Duke Energy, which says it generates more than a quarter of its energy from coal.&nbsp;Morgan Stanley has boardroom links to the oil and gas industry too; director Rayford Wilkins Jr is a sitting board member of Texas-based oil refining company Valero Energy.
Tom Sanzillo, director of financial analysis at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Moral Money that banks commonly hire directors from industry to deepen relationships with clients and improve their understanding of the space.
But having a number of directors with interests in highly polluting companies could be a “red flag”, Sanzillo said. Directors could “push banks to be in favour of fossil fuels at a time when there shouldn’t be major interest from a financial point of view”, and “undercut” policies that move money into competitor industries like wind, solar and electric cars.
On average, around one in every seven directors at Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan has ties to a company identified by Climate Action 100+ as a top global polluter, for example in aviation, steel, coal mining or oil and gas. This includes working as a director, chief executive or investment officer.
The more senior the position on a bank’s board, the more concerning the crossover, Sanzillo added.
“It’s an ethical question. All things considered, you have to test it with your gut.”
Bank directors serving on the board of unconnected industrial companies is not “inherently wrong”, and can bring “beneficial insight to both sides”, said Roger Barker, director of policy and governance at the UK’s Institute of Directors.
But to mitigate reputational risk, directors in such a position should “adopt an independent perspective and work hard to exert a positive impact on the sustainability profile of the polluter,” Barker added.
Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have all pledged to reduce emissions from their lending and investment portfolio to net zero by 2050 through membership of the Net Zero Banking Alliance.
And according to data from the Rainforest Action Network, these banks have cut their lending and underwriting of debt and equity issuances to oil, gas and coal companies by nearly a third in just a year; they extended a combined $133.1bn last year, compared with $196.4bn in 2021.
JPMorgan said in response to these figures that it provides financing across the energy sector, “supporting energy security, helping clients accelerate their low carbon transition and increasing clean energy financing with a target of $1tn for green initiatives by 2030.”
The relationship between banks and the energy sector is shrinking but still large, making directors’ second jobs “shocking” but “not surprising”, said Caleb Schwartz, a research and policy analyst at RAN.
The practice is also common in Europe. The head of Barclays’s remuneration committee, Brian Gilvary, was formerly the chief financial officer at BP and now serves as non-executive chair of Ineos Energy, which said earlier this year that it was acquiring thousands of Texan oil wells. Amanda Blanc, chief executive of the insurer Aviva, is a non-executive director at BP. Blanc has no oversight of investment decisions by the group’s asset manager, Aviva Investors.
And DeSmog’s investigation also raises concerns about biodiversity risk. JPMorgan’s Virginia M Rometty, a member of the bank’s governance committee, sits on the board of Cargill, the agribusiness giant facing a legal complaint over Amazon deforestation. The bank has participated in an estimated $7.3bn-worth of Cargill bond and loan deals over the past decade, according to supply chain transparency group Trase.
Barclays said: “Our non-executive directors are chosen for the experience and insight they are able to bring to their roles”, including oversight of the bank’s goal to “be net zero by 2050”.
Wells Fargo said its board members are “highly qualified individuals from diverse backgrounds who have the leadership, executive management, financial, industry, and other expertise to act in the best interests of our company and its shareholders.”&nbsp;
Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Aviva declined to comment. JPMorgan declined to comment on its directors.
The directors did not respond to requests for comment through the banks and through Ineos Energy. (Kenza Bryan)
Whether they are sustainable investors or not, shareholders seem to be growing leery of companies that fail to disclose their carbon emissions, according to Wall Street firm Lazard.
In a new report, Lazard found that companies in the Russell 3000 index that report emissions tended to have lower price-to-earnings ratios than peers that don’t. Only about one-sixth of the Russell 3000 companies are voluntarily disclosing their emissions.
The research found no similar correlation between company valuations and promises of emission cuts. This suggests that companies will be rewarded for increased transparency — even if they are reporting ugly emission figures.
“We found that disclosures matter, but commitments don’t,” Peter Orszag, head of financial advisory at Lazard, told me. Orszag was previously director of the US Office of Management and Budget under the Obama administration.
“Without disclosures, investors assume the worst and they may apply an even larger discount” to the share price, he said. “The general atmosphere is one in which investors will look at [pledges to cut emissions] as largely rhetorical.”
There was a particularly strong link between carbon disclosures and stock valuation at industrial companies and utilities, the research found.
Ultimately, corporate laggards on carbon emissions disclosures will be pulled into the daylight by the Securities and Exchange Commission when the agency adopts climate disclosures at some point this year.&nbsp;
The rules would require companies to disclose scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as scope 3 emissions in certain high-polluting industries.
But until then, investors remain in the dark about corporate emissions and their risks. Investors are likely to continue discounting the risks they cannot see. (Patrick Temple-West)
Joe Biden’s landmark green bill is set to prove far more expensive than expected — and that’s a very good thing, writes Paul Krugman in the New York Times.

Greetings from Los Angeles, where I have arrived to take part in the Milken conference. A hot topic for debate at this year’s event is the state of artificial intelligence, and the striking advances made by OpenAI with the ChatGPT tool. This is creating heated speculation about the battles between Microsoft and Google — not to mention Amazon and Facebook — for market share in the AI sphere.
However, these issues are also provoking discussion in the sustainability world for two distinct reasons. One is that entrepreneurs are developing AI tools to help investors monitor risks around ESG (a topic that Moral Money will write about later this week). The second is that some investors are wondering whether they should look at tech companies’ attitudes towards AI when deciding whether to include them in ESG baskets — or not. Nicolai Tangen, head of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, an ESG leader, set the ball rolling late last week when he revealed that the fund would be setting guidelines for “ethical” AI for the 9,000-odd companies that it invests in. Few of the other big asset managers attending Milken have commented on this yet. But there is rising pressure for them to follow suit.
Meanwhile, in today’s newsletter we explore two other novel innovations: the battle to develop guilt-free flying via sustainable jet fuel, and a fierce debate around the ethics of developing techniques to resurrect long-dead species such as the woolly mammoth. The latter (like AI) might not be a classic area of ESG; but it shows how the concept of “ethical” business and finance is shifting, as innovation accelerates. As ever, let us know what you think, about mammoths, robots, planes — or anything else. (Gillian Tett)
As pressure mounts to meet global net zero goals, carbon markets are in the spotlight. Approaches vary from cap-and-trade compliance schemes to voluntary carbon markets and internal carbon pricing. Meanwhile, some argue that to reduce emissions at sufficient scale and speed, carbon taxes are essential. The next FT Moral Money Forum report will explore the options and review the opportunities. And we want to hear from you. Do you favour carbon taxes? Can voluntary markets overcome quality concerns? Will compliance markets do more to push business to decarbonise? Share your thoughts here.
For decades, it looked like the prospects for hydrogen-driven flight had crashed and burnt along with the Hindenburg, the German airship that met a fiery end in 1937.
But through investments in start-up ZeroAvia, companies from Amazon to Shell are betting that hydrogen can once again be at the forefront of global aviation.
“This is the beginning of guilt-free flying, if you will,” ZeroAvia’s founder Val Miftakhov told me, standing in a hangar in the English Cotswolds.
A physicist trained in Russia and then at Princeton University, Miftakhov went on to work at McKinsey and Google before founding eMotorWerks, which created one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging networks. Having sold that company to Italy’s Enel in 2017, Miftakhov turned his attention to aviation.
While the automotive industry was embarking on a major shift away from fossil fuels, Miftakhov, an amateur pilot, was struck by how nothing similar appeared to be in the offing for aeroplanes, which produce about 3 per cent of global carbon emissions.
He soon set his sights on hydrogen fuel cells. Batteries are far too heavy for all but the shortest flights. And greener forms of combustion — whether of “sustainable aviation fuel” made using captured carbon, or of pure hydrogen — would still produce the contrail exhaust that accounts for a hefty chunk of aviation’s global warming effect.
His team made swift progress on their fuel cell, which combines hydrogen with oxygen to create electricity that then powers a motor. In 2019 they began test flights of a six-seater aircraft powered by a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and batteries — though they hit a setback in 2021 when a test pilot was forced to crash land after the electricity cut out.
Since January they’ve been running a test flight of a 20-seater aircraft with one engine powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. For now, the other is a conventional petrol-powered one — but Miftakhov claims the company is on track to have a fully hydrogen-powered system for 20-seater planes on the market in 2025. After that they want an engine for a 70-seater on sale in 2027, with one for regional jets — which can carry up to 100 people — to follow in 2029.
All this will require clearance from regulators — first of all in the UK, where ZeroAvia has created its test centre next to Cotswolds Airport in Gloucestershire, drawn by an early slug of financial support from the British government. Once the regulatory all-clear is given, sales will be quick to follow, Miftakhov hopes — citing interest from airlines American, United, Alaska and British Airways parent IAG, all of which have invested in ZeroAvia.
ZeroAvia’s ambitious road map reflects an increasingly competitive landscape. In March, California-based Universal Hydrogen carried out a test flight of a 40-seater plane with one of its engines powered by a fuel cell. Meanwhile (as we highlighted in a recent edition), many airlines — and aviation regulators — are putting sustainable aviation fuel at the centre of their decarbonisation strategy.
But Miftakhov says it is only a matter of time before the entire aviation industry moves to hydrogen. Along with its superior environmental footprint, he argues, it will offer significantly lower cost, as the “green hydrogen” ecosystem, producing hydrogen with abundant renewable electricity, mushrooms.
“For heavy-duty applications, hydrogen is the best way to pack renewable energy,” he said. “You can fly on electricity, you just need to use the right medium to pack that electricity onboard the aircraft and hydrogen is the best way to do it.” (Simon Mundy)
Why are some environmentally conscious investors getting interested in the long-extinct woolly mammoth? Ben Lamm, co-founder and chief executive of Colossal Biosciences, told me his company was on track to have the first calves of a genetically engineered mammoth by 2028 — with the help of a bumper funding round that has given the start-up a 10-figure dollar valuation.
Founded in 2019 by Lamm — a serial tech entrepreneur — and Harvard Medical School professor of genetics George Church, Colossal Biosciences aims to recreate new versions of the long-extinct species such as the woolly mammoth, dodo and Tasmanian tiger.
The company will do this using cutting-edge technologies in genetic engineering such as Crispr, a genome editing tool that can be used to make changes to DNA in specific points. The technology will be used to alter the genome of the Asian elephant — the mammoth’s closest living relative, which shares 99.6 per cent of its DNA. By changing a relatively small number of genes, the team hopes it can create an animal with all the key characteristics of the extinct mammoth.
To learn why scientists are embarking on such a project, we need to look towards the Arctic. Thawing permafrost in the Arctic has been found to be a major emitter of greenhouse gases. One study led by a researcher at Northern Arizona University found that melting Arctic permafrost could release emissions equivalent to that of a large industrial nation.
This is where the mammoth comes in. These massive animals that weigh up to 8 tonnes are being considered as a part of the solution to the melting permafrost; as mammoths and other hulking creatures trample on the ground, they pack snow on the surface tighter, helping to cool the soil underneath.
In fact, studies conducted in Siberia’s Pleistocene Park — with which Colossal Biosciences had worked closely prior to the war in Ukraine — found that the reintroduction of animals managed to cool the ground temperature by up to eight degrees, according to Lamm.
That said, there’s still a long way to go. “Even though we’ll have calves in 2028, it’ll be a while before they’re ready to be rewilded,” says Lamm. “Any rewilding project regardless of whether it’s extinct species, or a species that we eradicated from an environment like we did with wolves in Yellowstone National Park here in the United States, is one that needs to be thoughtfully taken.”
While the company is working primarily in Alaska at the moment, “our goal is to work with all the nations of the Arctic Circle to ensure that we reintroduce [the mammoths] over time”, Lamm said.
As of its most recent fundraising round in January, Colossal Biosciences has raised a total of $230mn and notched a valuation of $1.45bn, according to data from PitchBook.
Soaring interest in Colossal Biosciences shows that investors are increasingly looking outside the box for climate solutions. Among its investors is At One Ventures, a venture capital company investing in regenerative technologies for the planet, as well as Climate Capital, an early-stage climate tech venture capital firm that focuses on companies working on decarbonising the global economy.
While there’s certainly a lot of hype surrounding the de-extinction company, there are also many sceptics that warn of the risks it presents. Some even accuse the company of playing God.
“I think we play God every day,” said Lamm. He argues that it would be “unethical not to develop these technologies”, adding that&nbsp;“it’s important for us to leverage the tools and technologies that we have to either undo some of the sins of the past or actually better help the planet. I think that is our ethical and moral responsibility.” (Kaori Yoshida, Nikkei)
The regulatory net is closing around companies that have treated climate pledges as a cheap brand-polishing exercise, warns Richard Black of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.

What comes after peak coal?,Coal,"This article is an on-site version of our Energy Source newsletter. Sign up here&nbsp;to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday
Welcome back to Energy Source.
Global temperatures will probably rise to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time within the next five years as a coming El Niño weather phenomenon amplifies man-made temperature increases, the World Meteorological Organization said yesterday.
The effect of El Niño, which warms the Pacific Ocean, will be temporary. But the likelihood of even briefly breaching the key 1.5C threshold in the next few years will be a key moment that reverberates through the climate movement and energy industry.
Cutting down on the world’s reliance on coal-fuelled power is at the centre of efforts to keep temperatures from rising further. Those efforts may be bearing fruit; coal consumption in the global power system could peak this year, according to Wood Mackenzie. But getting to peak demand is just the start. That is the topic of today’s first note from me.
In Data Drill, Amanda looks at how America’s love affair with the Sport Utility Vehicle is shaping the electric vehicle revolution.
Thanks for reading — Justin
Last year’s energy crisis drove coal use around the world to record highs as power producers from China to India to Germany scoured the globe for fuel supply in a worrying trend for the fight to reduce planet-warming emissions.
But global coal use in the power sector could peak this year, according to the consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
“As evidenced from last year, it’s safe to say that the world isn’t done with coal yet. In fact, this year we’re projecting to see a record year for global demand for thermal coal,” said Natalie Biggs, global head of coal markets at Wood Mackenzie. “That being said, thermal coal is still set for a permanent decline after this year as decarbonisation goals are taking root, particularly for developed economies.”
However, peak coal does not mean the end of coal. Rather, Wood Mackenzie’s outlook shows a gentle decline for the fuel. Even with a peak this year, consumption is on track to be only slightly lower in 2030 than it was in 2015, according to the group.
That slow ebb poses a big challenge for the climate fight.
The International Energy Agency has said that hitting the world’s 2050 net zero emissions goals, and keeping a lid on temperature rises, would require not just a peak in coal demand but also a quick and dramatic decline in the world’s coal usage. Emissions from coal need to be all but scrubbed out of the global power system by 2040, the IEA says.
The US and Europe are more or less on that trajectory with coal-fired plants being shut down and the fuel likely to be “nearly completely phased out” by 2040, Biggs said.
It’s a different story in Asia, especially in China and India, where demand for coal is still growing.
Both countries are ploughing huge amounts of cash into deploying renewable energy. But coal is still the cheapest way to generate electricity in both nations, and it’s expected to remain that way for many years, “which means that demand for coal in Asia will remain strong,” Biggs said.
In a sign of what could be coming for oil and other fossil fuel markets, peak demand does not mean coal is necessarily about to get cheap. Pressure on supplies from low investment and climate campaigners lobbying investors to cut ties with the industry mean producers may struggle to keep up with even declining demand.
“Coal supply faces issues with chronic under-investment,” Biggs said. “Major banks are under pressure to stop providing financing for coal projects and [environmental, social and governance] pledges to hold investments in coal are growing.”
“Even major diversified miners are facing shareholder pressure to divest in coal mining segments and this comes despite record profits seen last year,” she added. (Justin Jacobs)
The American obsession with big cars has big implications for electric vehicle adoption and its carbon footprint.
Electric SUVs made up 60 per cent of all US EV sales in 2022, compared to 39 per cent worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency’s recent outlook.
SUVs are also making up a growing share of the available electric models on the market. SUVs and large cars made up more than 80 per cent of all electric models in the US in 2022, up from about 50 per cent in 2018 and surpassing their current petrol-powered share of 70 per cent.
James Di Filippo, a senior policy analyst at think-tank Atlas Public Policy, said the trend towards electric SUVs is driven by a combination of consumer interest, wider profit margins, and favourable policy.
“[SUVs] are the most popular vehicles. If you’re entering into the EV space with a new vehicle, you’re going to want to put your first foot into a very popular space,” Di Filippo said.
The affinity for SUVs is expected to be reinforced by President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a $7,500 tax credit for consumers purchasing an EV that meets certain sourcing and assembly requirements.
The Treasury loosened vehicle classifications to allow more SUVs to qualify for the tax credit in February. As of today, only two non SUVs or large car models qualify for the full credit: Tesla’s Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt, the latter of which is going to be discontinued at the end of the year.
The preference for bigger EVs comes with a trade-off. The IEA found that in France, Germany, and the UK, an electric SUV’s battery was twice as large as the one in a small EV, requiring 75 per cent more critical minerals and generating 70 per cent more emissions in the manufacturing process.
“Generally, the larger the battery, the more metals are used,” said Chris Burton, global head of commodities at Credit Suisse Asset Management. “We have to make sure that there’s enough supply for that, and there’s only so much that can be saved by thrifting certain metals or improving the recycling.”
Aside from sustainability, the prevalence of larger electric models means there are few cheap options for consumers. An average US electric SUV cost $54,000 in 2022, roughly $20,000 more than the average small electric model, according to the IEA. More than eight in 10 Americans cited cost as a reason not to buy an EV in a recent survey by University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute and the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Biden wants EVs to make up 50 per cent of all car sales by 2030. But last year EVs made up just under 8 per cent of all car sales, according to the IEA.
“The US still has a lot to learn from, let’s say China, in terms of how to manufacture compact cars,” said Abhishek Murali, an electric vehicle analyst at Rystad Energy. “That is one of the main things that impedes US EV adoption.” Rystad tracked nine EV model announcements in the US in 2022, all of them were SUVs.

Fund managers cut commercial property exposure to lowest since 2008,Commercial property,"Fund managers have cut their allocations to commercial real estate to their lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, in the latest sign that investors are becoming concerned about the impact of rising interest rates and falling demand on the sector.
Bank of America’s monthly fund manager survey showed that a net 19 per cent of managers globally were underweight the sector in May, the lowest level of exposure since December 2008,
In a sign of how quickly investors’ attitudes towards the sector have changed, investors’ allocations had hit their highest in at least 16 years in April last year, with a net 19 per cent of managers overweight the sector.
The survey adds to growing caution as steep rises in interest rates, falling prices and waning demand for office space following the coronavirus pandemic weigh on investor confidence.
The outlook for the US office sector looks particularly bleak.
Apollo Global Management’s co-president has been among executives to warn on the commercial property sector while last month Berkshire Hathaway vice-chair Charlie Munger pointed to a brewing storm in the US commercial property market, saying banks were “full” of “bad loans”.
Capital Economics has forecast the US commercial property sector will experience a 22 per cent peak-to-trough decline in value with offices suffering even worse as a result of falling rents and declining occupancy levels following the pandemic.
“The outlook for the US office sector looks particularly bleak,” said Kiran Raichura, deputy chief property economist at Capital Economics.
The shift towards more remote and hybrid work since the start of the pandemic will lead to significant valuation declines for offices in San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington, according to Capital.
Concerns about the outlook for the US economy have pushed US banks to tighten their lending standards for all categories of commercial real estate loans, according to the latest senior loan officer survey published by the Federal Reserve in May.
“The extent to which these more restrictive lending practices impede existing borrowers from refinancing [CRE loans] remains to be seen,” said Alan Todd, head of commercial mortgage-backed securities strategy at Bank of America.
Investors are also concerned that the problems in the commercial real estate sector could escalate into a wider systemic threat to the stability of financial markets.
Just under half of the fund managers surveyed by BofA cited commercial real estate as the most likely cause of a systemic event, compared with just 8 per cent that viewed a downgrade on US sovereign debt owing to the impasse in Washington over the government’s borrowing limit as the main risk."
‘Stranded assets’: investors reckon with obsolete offices,Commercial property,"The Atrium is a black glass office tower glowering over the town centre of Uxbridge, 16 miles west of London. It symbolises a problem facing commercial property investors across the UK.
The 1990s building, which counts multi-level marketing company Herbalife among its remaining tenants, is now roughly half empty. The Atrium is not alone: a quarter of the office space in the commuter town near the M25 motorway sits vacant.
BlackRock bought the Atrium block from insurer Aviva in 2015 for £55mn. The US investment giant has been marketing the property recently for as little as £16mn, according to sales documents.
The marketing materials include studies on how to revamp the building as flats, but the project would be difficult given its vast scale.
“If it wasn’t a death star, it would have already been converted to residential,” said a real estate executive familiar with the local market, who said similar buildings faced an existential threat. “You can duck, dodge, dive and weave and you’re not going to get the space let. They can’t be repurposed for anything unless you raze them.”&nbsp;
BlackRock declined to comment.
The uncertain future demand for office space, given the popularity of hybrid working in the wake of the pandemic, has made workplaces the epicentre of anxiety about the wider commercial property market, which has been buffeted by rising interest rates. In the UK, older offices in peripheral locations are the most threatened.
Meanwhile, fears from prominent US investors have made asset managers and lenders anxious about office deals, and transactions have dried up.
“Most of the big private equity won’t touch offices,” said a London-based property debt adviser. “If you say ‘office’ to any investor from the US, they practically throw up on your shoes.”&nbsp;
More than 100mn sq ft of office space is now vacant across the UK, the highest in nine years, according to CoStar, which analyses commercial real estate. The amount of empty space has climbed steadily since Covid-19 struck, and is now 65 per cent higher than March 2020.
“The pace at which assets are becoming stranded assets is actually accelerating quite a lot,” said Raimondo Amabile, global chief investment officer at PGIM real estate. “We should not underestimate how fast this can go, since the office market has represented a big part of the investment market.”&nbsp;
The US office market has also been badly hit, with vacancy rates rising sharply in major cities like San Francisco and New York. Berkshire Hathaway vice-chair Charlie Munger warned last month of “agony” in the office market and the risk from bad property loans.
In major European and UK cities, workers have been quicker to return to the office. The market for office space has split between strong demand for top-end space and lacklustre interest in other buildings.
The vacancy rate in parts of London’s west end is as low as 3 per cent, with even less available space in high-end buildings with environmental certifications where tenants will sign leases several years in advance to secure space.
Grant Lonsdale, director of market analytics at CoStar, said companies were “vacating older and less energy-efficient buildings”.&nbsp;Two-thirds of the vacant space in the UK is in buildings that are more than 20 years old, according to CoStar.
Some large, older office buildings are also almost impossible to repurpose because their vast floors are hard to divide into flats. Their values have already plunged, and will probably have to fall further before developers will be able to turn a profit by buying the buildings, knocking them down and reusing the land for flats or warehouses.
While city centres remain relatively popular, further-out locations such as Uxbridge — which sits at the end of London’s Metropolitan and Piccadilly underground lines — are struggling. But there are big variations, even in desirable areas, depending on the specific location, age and quality of the building.
Last week, wealth manager St James’s Place’s property fund, managed by Orchard Street, sold an ageing art deco block in London’s Soho to Great Portland Estate for £39mn, 30 per cent less than it paid to buy the property in 2018. Orchard Street and SJP declined to comment, but a person with knowledge of the deal said the building was sold for more than its most recent valuation.
Many institutional investors, including asset managers who own large regional office portfolios, have been looking to reduce their stock of offices. Selling pressure has increased since the autumn “mini-budget”, which set off a flood of investors pulling money from property funds, forcing funds run by M&amp;G, Schroders and others to restrict redemptions.
BlackRock’s UK property fund, which owns the Atrium in Uxbridge, was among those frozen last year. The fund started partially repaying investors last month. A person with knowledge of the matter said the fund already owned fewer offices that its peers.
Asset managers looking to get rid of unloved office buildings have limited options to sell. “The market isn’t there to buy those assets. A desire to reweight portfolios is different from an ability to do so,” said Bill Page, head of real estate markets research at LGIM.
Still, a few investors are seeing opportunities in the bleak office market. Mark Harrison, chief executive of Praxis, said his company had spent more than £400mn on buying offices and plans to expand the purchases to £1bn. By buying the properties cheaply, Praxis could afford to improve them and still offer lower rents, he said.
“Markets generally overreact and they certainly have when it comes to offices,” said Harrison. “The distressed sellers of this kind of real estate have bought into a negative feedback loop.”&nbsp;
Older offices face another headwind from new environmental standards, brought in to help reduce the 39 per cent of energy-related carbon emission that comes from buildings and help the UK meet its net zero targets.
In some UK cities, including Northampton, Huddersfield and Leicester, a fifth or more of the office stock is currently below the minimum green standards, according to analysis by the Centre for Cities. The think-tank warned the policy could lead to a large number of “stranded assets”, including offices as well as shops, especially in northern towns and cities.
Valentine Quinio, senior analyst at the Centre for Cities, said: “The risk essentially is that there will be a number of places where these properties become stranded assets because they are unable to be let out in their current condition, but they also can’t secure a rent that is high enough to make the investment worth it.”"
ED&F Man plans new $1bn debt restructuring,Commodities,"ED&amp;F Man plans to restructure nearly $1bn of debt and has raised $300mn of new financing for its main trading business after the UK broker’s banking covenants restricted its ability to trade through the commodities boom.
The broker, one of the oldest commodities brokers in London, is seeking to ringfence its commodities division from its old debts and inject the funds into the unit to restore trading volumes, according to a shareholder letter seen by the Financial Times.
The move comes just 18 months after ED&amp;F Man restructured $1.5bn of debt and raised $320mn in working capital to stave off a funding crunch. But the broker, which acts as a middleman in global commodities markets, told shareholders its projections had been hit by unforeseen soaring prices of commodities including sugar and coffee. They have become more expensive to trade because brokers and clearing houses have asked for more margin to support futures contracts.
ED&amp;F Man is 35 per cent-owned by Südzucker, the German sugar producer, which has veto power over big transactions. The remainder is owned by current and former employees, mainly in management roles. It employs nearly 6,000 people and generated an operating profit of $104mn on turnover of $6.9bn in the year to September 2020. Südzucker did not respond to a request for comment.
The tough banking covenants and company leverage has curbed trading for the past six months, and hit its ability to both pay down debt and raise additional finance, it said in a letter, dated February 3.
It warned in the letter that its commodities business had “missed trading opportunities in 2021 and now, due to the ongoing restrictions, have already missed a significant part of 2022 trading”. ED&amp;F was further worried that the restrictions would mean traders would leave.
“The company considers that the business will soon reach a tipping point beyond which the damage caused to the business by ongoing missed trading opportunities and continued trading constraints may become irreversible,” it added.
Last year the group had total borrowing of nearly $1.7bn, comprising $1.3bn of term loans and revolving credit facilities that mature by September 2023. Under the new plan slightly less than $1bn of debt will be extended until 2025.
In a separate communication with shareholders, the management said it was confident the plan would be sanctioned at a London court hearing on February 24, and it had reached agreement with more than 75 per cent of its lenders. “We have received commitments to the new trade finance facility totalling over $300mn,” it added.
ED&amp;F Man in a statement described the move as “a positive step that will benefit the company and its stakeholders” as the additional liquidity would enable the group to recover commodities trading volumes.
The reporting of ED&amp;F Man’s 2021 results has been delayed because of the move, but it told shareholders that the scale of adjustments to net profits “would be similar to last year”. Südzucker has warned that the book value of ED&amp;F Man dropped to €34mn from €89mn in the year to November 2021."
Europe seeks to kick-start sluggish corporate bond market,Corporate bonds,"Banks, regulators and fund managers are gearing up for a fresh Brussels-led effort to jump-start trading in Europe’s corporate bond market, which has been held back by a stubborn lack of transparency.
The European Commission has this year initiated a push founded on the creation of a central database to hold vital trading information such as the price, size, yield and trading venue of bond transactions.
The move reflects a recognition that despite sweeping reforms three years ago the market remains too opaque in the eyes of many investors, who also face a mishmash of data because trading venues report trades differently.
The commission signalled in January that its underlying concern was that poor transparency was hampering the development of EU capital markets as it seeks to reduce the EU’s reliance on the City of London.
Policymakers have found a potential model for better reporting in the US’s Trace system, which is used to log over-the-counter transactions in fixed income securities.
Brussels has confirmed that a so-called consolidated “tape” — a live database containing basic trading information — will be part of reforms it plans to unveil later this year.
Its previous attempt to build a tape via the 2014 Mifid II markets rules put the onus on private companies to build one, but nothing emerged.
Nicholas Bean, global head of electronic trading solutions at Bloomberg, said: “Under the current [Mifid II] regulatory framework, operating a consolidated tape is not a commercially viable proposition, even at cost.”
“If this is addressed through regulatory changes, we will perform the necessary due diligence to see whether we could bring — or assist in bringing — benefits to our clients and the broader market in facilitating the operation of a tape.”
Brussels is also considering plans to revamp its system of waivers and deferrals on reporting for illiquid bonds, according to two people familiar with the commission’s thinking. The current system means around 96 per cent of deals do not have to be reported to the market immediately.
The authorities’ efforts to build secondary market trading have been hit by the European Central Bank’s corporate bond-buying programme in recent years, which has mopped up and held €281bn of bonds and sharply reduced market liquidity.
A report for the commission by UK consultancy Market Structure Partners last year pointed out that a closing price in the bond market often bore no relationship to the trade price.
This month the Dutch Authority for The Financial Markets, one of the EU’s most influential regulators, urged a “fundamental rethink” in Brussels of the region’s bond market.&nbsp;“The lack of transparency is the direct result of the current structure of the EU’s fixed income market,” it said.
One London data provider, Ediphy, is trying to build industry support for an “at-cost” utility that pulls together the fragmented trading reports. Its efforts have drawn the support of fund managers Groupama Asset Management, ING and KBC. The Dutch regulator is also watching the project.
Ediphy aims to supply the technology for a consolidated tape that would be overseen by another private company, said Christopher Murphy, founder and chief executive. “Our only objective is to consolidate what is to be made public,” he said.
Potential operators also have to meet regulatory standards some feel are impossibly high. EU rules stipulate that a tape covers four-fifths of the total volume of transactions across Europe.
But the Market Structure Partners highlighted discrepancies in officially published data, citing analysis by Ediphy that found some 17,500 securities identification tags, or ISINs, were wrongly classified.
“It is therefore unlikely that any [tape provider] can be confident that they have met the 80 per cent threshold requirement,” said the Market Structure report."
Credit Suisse CDS: déjà vu all over again,Credit Suisse Group AG,"You wait nearly two months for a question to be filed with the CDS determinations committee regarding Credit Suisse and then two come along at once.
Earlier in the week, FT Alphaville delved into what we dubbed Schrödinger’s swap, an audacious plan to trigger credit-default swaps on Credit Suisse, which most in the market had assumed would not pay out.
While we would love it if you read the nearly 2,500 word dissection of the trade, the TL;DR version is this: two hedge funds thought the ambiguity over the ranking of a dead Credit Suisse bond was enough to turn the AT1 wipeout into a CDS payout.
Unfortunately the all-powerful CDS determinations committee did not agree. On Wednesday, the panel of market participants peered&nbsp;inside the box marked “Credit Suisse Group AG subordinated credit-default swap contract” and unanimously decided that the cat inside was very much alive:
There’s much more to say on the implications of the decision (stay tuned), but shortly after we to put pen to paper on this, another CS CDS question hit:
Has a Bankruptcy Credit Event occurred with respect to Credit Suisse Group AG?
The DC question has been raised in respect of Standard European Corporate, Standard European Financial Corporate and Standard European CoCo Financial Corporate Transaction Types. In respect of the Financial Transaction Types, the DC question relates to both the Senior and Subordinated Level.
In particular, the Eligible Market Participant who submitted the question has requested that the EMEA DC consider whether a Bankruptcy Credit Event has occurred with respect to Credit Suisse Group AG under Section 4.2(b) or 4.2(h) of the 2014 Definitions.
The eagle-eyed FTAV readers will have no doubt noticed several key differences to the first question.
Firstly, this one concerns both the senior and subordinated CDS contracts, rather than only the latter.
Secondly, this is concerns whether a “bankruptcy credit event” has occurred, rather than a “governmental intervention credit event”.
This may seem plainly silly to those unversed in the ways of CDS: Credit Suisse did not file for bankruptcy. But the key nuance here is related to the Section 4.2(b) referenced in the question (the other section referenced is a bit of a catch-all clause and is a little less relevant).
Section 4.2(b) means that the CDS can trigger if Credit Suisse “becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing in a judicial, regulatory or administrative proceeding or filing its inability generally to pay its debt as they become due” (our emphasis added).
In the world of CDS, loose lips can sink ships. Which will be why the submitters have appended documents such as a speech from Credit Suisse chair Axel Lehmann and an interview with Swiss finance minister Karin Keller-Sutter.
Will it work? Our gut is that, again, it feels like a bit of a long-shot. But also that the communications around the shotgun-marriage-cum-rescue-operation that merged UBS and Credit Suisse have been so messy that you never know.
At any rate, the DC has very quickly accepted the question:
So the wise men of the CDS at the very least think it is a topic worthy of debate.
Stay tuned."
Credit Suisse bondholders force Swiss regulator to release AT1 wipeout decree,Credit Suisse Group AG,"Credit Suisse’s bondholders have forced Switzerland’s financial regulator to divulge the decree that wiped out their investments, handing them an early victory in the legal battle to overturn the controversial writedown.
Investors representing at least $4.5bn of wiped-out Credit Suisse additional tier 1 bonds filed a lawsuit against Finma last month. The suit accuses Switzerland’s banking regulator of having acted unconstitutionally when it ordered the bank to cancel the $17bn of AT1 bonds as a part of its shotgun marriage to UBS two months ago.
The aggrieved investors and their law firm Quinn Emanuel had to launch their challenge largely in the dark, as Finma had kept secret the wording of its decree ordering Credit Suisse to write down their investments.
However, the judge overseeing the case, which was filed in the city of St Gallen in eastern Switzerland, ordered the financial regulator to hand over the decree last week, giving the AT1 bondholders a firmer foothold to contest the writedown.
In addition to the decree that Finma issued to Credit Suisse ordering the bank to wipe out the AT1 bonds, the Swiss government issued two emergency ordinances that explicitly expanded the regulator’s powers under Swiss law to do so.
The first ordinance on Thursday March 16 did not mention the AT1 bonds. But on Sunday March 19, as the rescue was finalised, officials added the line: “Finma may order the borrower and the financial group to write down additional Tier 1 capital”. The government said this gave Finma a “clearer legal basis” to wipe out the bonds.
Finma has publicly said the contractual conditions were met to write down the bonds, because Credit Suisse drew on government-backed liquidity facilities in the days before its rescue by UBS.
This provoked outcry from bondholders because the AT1 bonds could only be written down if government assistance also bolstered the bank’s capital ratios, which many investors argued was not the case given Swiss authorities only intervened to aid Credit Suisse’s liquidity.
A copy of Finma’s decree seen by the Financial Times states that the government-backed facilities had “a direct positive effect on the liquidity and capital situation”. The regulator added that this satisfied the so-called “viability event” clause in the bond’s documents and meant that Credit Suisse “was therefore able to write off the AT1 instruments on its own initiative”.
One bondholder said the fact that the decree explicitly sets out Finma’s interpretation of the contracts governing the AT1 bonds gives them a clearer opening to challenge the writedown.
“Before it seemed like you were fighting a law, or an ordinance, which made it a constitutional fight” in which investors were less likely to prevail, he said. “Now it’s back in the realm of contracts.”
The investor also argued that Finma’s reasoning that drawing on liquidity facilities also bolstered Credit Suisse’s capital was “absurd” and could have set a worrying precedent in the market for European bank capital bonds.
“That a bank supervisor would say such a thing is incredible,” he added. “If every time a bank draws on central bank money it triggers their AT1s then we’d be in a real mess.”
Finma declined to comment.
The decree also sheds further light on the scale of the bank run that hit Credit Suisse in the days before the takeover was agreed.
Finma noted that following a run of withdrawals on the back of a crisis in US regional lenders, Credit Suisse “reached its internal cash limit with the Swiss National Bank” in mid-March and that a fall below this value risked that the bank would “no longer be able to execute its payment transactions properly”.
Credit Suisse applied to the SNB for SFr39bn in liquidity assistance on March 15, which was granted the following day. After the bank was hit with SFr14bn of outflows in a single day on March 16 and faced further withdrawals the next day, Credit Suisse applied for a further SFr20bn liquidity facility on March 17.
Then, because the “liquidity situation at [Credit Suisse] worsened despite all measures taken”, the Swiss government had to provide a “default guarantee” to enable “liquidity assistance loan” to the bank on March 19, the day of the takeover."
ISDA* happening!,Credit Suisse Group AG,"While plebs wonder if UBS is now too big, and rubes muse whether global banks can ever really be smoothly wound down, the crediterati have been speculating whether Credit Suisse actually defaulted in its forced merger with its Swiss rival.
And now it looks like we might find out. A Bloomberg news spike alert made Alphaville scurry over to the website of the International Swap and Derivatives Association Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, and, lo:
This week, someone finally asked the determinations committees — a group of up to 10 representatives from banks and five from investment groups that decides whether credit-default swaps pay out — whether CS defaulted.
*Here we should note that ISDA, which originally set up the DC system back in 2009 and acted as its secretary, in 2018 transferred the admin work to an ISDA subsidiary called DC Administration Services is that is nominally independent. ISDA’s docs still set the standard for credit derivatives.
Longtime Alphavillain readers will recall Lisa Pollack’s oeuvre on the machinations and ruminations of the DCs, which operate not dissimilarly to a papal conclave choosing a new pope and announcing the decision with white or black smoke.
Now, we still don’t know if the DC will decide to even hear the case (this is just flagging that someone has asked it to make a ruling), but we suspect that it will have to.
There was about $20bn of CDS on CS debt at the time of its collapse, and, as Risk reported at the time, it wasn’t “crystal clear” whether the AT1 bond vaporisation would trigger CDS payouts. But it seems some hedge funds have grown confident that it will.
From Bloomberg yesterday:
An illiquid corner of swaps insuring Credit Suisse Group AG debt surged back to life this week as some hedge funds make the case they should be triggered.
Funds including FourSixThree Capital and Diameter Capital Partners have been buying swaps insuring Credit Suisse’s subordinated bonds with the idea that the controversial writedown of the firm’s AT1 securities could prompt a potential payout of the derivative contracts, according to people familiar with the matter.
While the five-year credit default swaps dipped on Thursday, they’re up more than 80 basis points this week to about 360, according to CMAI prices. That’s the biggest increase since UBS Group AG agreed to buy Credit Suisse in an emergency weekend deal in March. As part of that acquisition, Swiss regulators forced the wipeout of about $17 billion of so-called Additional Tier 1 notes.

Rare good news from Credit Suisse with debt-for-nature swap deal,Credit Suisse Group AG,"This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.

Credit Suisse has struck a few fiendishly complicated deals over the past century and a half, such as the Mozambique “tuna bonds” that pushed the southern African country into a debt crisis.
Its latest deal, the world’s biggest ever debt-for-nature swap, is much better for its image. The $1.6bn debt swap restructures some of Ecuador’s increasingly cheap sovereign debt while directing an estimated $450mn towards marine conservation in the Galápagos.
For today’s edition I spoke to the president of the development bank that provided a crucial guarantee for the swap about his vision for more deals of this kind across Latin America.
Plus the chief executive of Calpers, the biggest pension plan in the US, tells Jo Cumbo about its responsibility to help stamp out “greenwashing”. (Kenza Bryan)
Credit Suisse has been in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons. But now there is a more encouraging reason to watch the Swiss bank. Even as it is swallowed up by arch-rival UBS, it is becoming an unlikely leader in innovative deals that repackage emerging market debt in exchange for promises to protect biodiversity.
After structuring and arranging the then-largest ever debt-for-nature swap for Belize in 2021,&nbsp;Credit Suisse said last week it had struck an even bigger (and more complicated) deal in Ecuador.
So how does this type of deal work? Credit Suisse bought $1.6bn of Ecuadorean government debt from the densely forested South American country — which is also in the middle of a brewing political crisis. Then, buoyed by guarantees and insurance from the US International Development Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Credit Suisse swapped the bonds via a special purpose vehicle for a smaller loan at a lower borrowing cost of just under 7 per cent for Ecuador.
What’s the link to nature? As part of the deal, Ecuador promised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marine conservation in the Galápagos. The twist also means Credit Suisse can, in theory, finance the bond purchase by issuing its own “blue” ocean-themed bonds, which ESG investors are keen to add to sustainable funds.
“This is not an individual ad hoc deal,” Ilan Goldfajn, recently elected president of the Washington-based IDB, told Moral Money last week after the bank helped get the deal off the ground. The IDB is in active discussions with other Central and South American countries with a view to doing more debt-for-nature swaps in coming months, he said, after receiving significant interest at the IMF spring meetings and its annual gathering in Panama.
The current global macroeconomic conditions support more deals of this kind, he said. “We are in a period where we had the pandemic, the Russia invasion, a moment where debt and fiscal issues are at the forefront . . . at the same time we’re at a moment where there is a push for reforms of international [development bank] organisations to try to be as efficient as possible.”
Before Ecuador, the development bank’s name has cropped up in some of the biggest deals of this kind. It provided a guarantee for a debt-for-nature swap in Barbados last year, and also advised on Uruguay’s $1.5bn bond issuance last year, which linked the cost of repayments to the country’s ability to reach deforestation and decarbonisation targets.&nbsp;Goldfajn said the bank had been investing a lot of resources in “financial innovation”.
A former governor of Brazil’s central bank, Goldfajn has more recently worked as an economist and director at the IMF, where he oversaw the launch of the fund’s first resilience and sustainability facility last year. The IMF has approved credit programmes tied to climate-change reform for Bangladesh, Barbados, Costa Rica, Jamaica and Rwanda, and disbursed its first payment to Costa Rica in March this year, according to a paper by the Centre for Global Development.
Goldfajn argues for more integration between development banks and the IMF, suggesting a joint fund could be created for guarantees for green finance instruments.
Although the IDB focuses on development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the appeal of debt-for-nature swaps could fast become global. Bank of America is reportedly preparing a similar deal for the summer, a $500mn debt swap for marine conservation in Gabon. We also hear development banks will be looking to discuss this type of agreement at Macron’s climate summit in Paris next month. (Kenza Bryan)
Companies prone to exaggerated sustainability claims are facing a gathering crackdown by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. They also have to contend with Calpers, the US’s biggest public pension plan, whose boss says it is determined to push companies for better information around climate-related risks.
Major institutional investors like Calpers, which manages a $442bn retirement fund on behalf of 2mn education sector workers in California, have come under pressure from environmental campaigners to take climate issues more seriously.
One of these pinch points has been “greenwashing”, or exaggerated claims by companies about their environmental performance.
Asked whether large asset owners such as Calpers could play a role in tackling greenwashing, chief executive Marcie Frost said the fund “had an obligation” to make sure that the markets were pricing climate risk “appropriately”.&nbsp;
“We have been a very strong voice around transparency and around getting the data we need to price that risk appropriately,” she told me in an interview.
But Frost defended Calpers’ decision to retain stakes in fossil fuel businesses, such as oil companies which deliver steady dividends. In California, there has been a renewed legislative push to force the fund to divest its fossil fuel holdings by 2030, a move which Frost said would force the fund to shed about $9.4bn of assets.
“Walking away from the sector — we don’t think that is the right answer today for an energy transition,” Frost said. “I’ve got a group here in California who don’t want any greenhouse gas emissions in the portfolio.&nbsp;If you really take this out, there’s no way we could get to a 6.8 [per cent] return assumption,” she added, referring to Calpers’ annual target for investment returns.
“We believe we have to be in with the companies . . . it’s going to take time and capital in order for these energy companies to do the transition to cleaner energy. Greenwashing can be real but if you are engaging appropriately with these companies to be more transparent, we see these companies actually provide the data we need to make decisions on their actions,” Frost said.

Schrödinger’s swap: the audacious plan to trigger Credit Suisse’s CDS,Credit Suisse Group AG,"Can a bond that no longer exists trigger a default?
This is the quasi-metaphysical question facing the panel of experts who have to determine whether Credit Suisse’s credit-default swap contracts will pay out. Call it Schrödinger’s swap.
While most in the market had assumed that Switzerland’s decision to vapourise $17bn of Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 bonds would not trigger the bank’s CDS (for reasons we’ll get into below), a couple of US hedge funds have wagered that nearly everyone has overlooked crucial quirks in the derivative contracts that could lead to a payout.
Bloomberg revealed last week that FourSixThree Capital and Diameter Capital Partners have loaded up on Credit Suisse CDS aiming to profit from a ruling that the swaps have in fact been triggered. On Thursday, a question was lodged with the Determinations Committee — the all-powerful panel of market representatives who make often-controversial rulings on whether credit-default swaps pay out — asking whether a so-called credit event has occurred at Credit Suisse (CDS aficionados will have noted that the question went in just a few days shy of the 60-day deadline after the AT1 bonds were written down).&nbsp;
The rationale behind why these funds are betting on a payout is not yet public, however. Bar some clues in the phrasing of the question submitted to the DC and the supporting documents attached, the wider world is none the wiser as to why two sophisticated hedge funds believe most of the market has missed a seismic event in the world of CDS.
In a bid to fill this void, FT Alphaville has spoken to several players with knowledge of the trade in order to set out as clearly as possible the thorny argument in favour of a CS CDS payout.
We can’t promise that the explanation will be straightforward. But you know you’re in for a wild ride when the supporting materials include documents as esoteric as a bond prospectus from the year 2000 and a more than a century old New York court judgment.
Before we get into the nitty gritty of the argument in favour of a trigger, it is first worth explaining why the majority of CDS traders had assumed there would be no payout on the Credit Suisse swaps.
CDS contracts written against bank bonds have two main classes: senior and subordinated, referencing the debt at the top and bottom of the capital structure, respectively.
You might naturally assume that when Swiss authorities wiped out $17bn of Credit Suisse’s deeply subordinated AT1 bonds, as a condition of the bank’s shotgun wedding to UBS, it would trigger payouts on the latter set of contracts.
Indeed, the International Swap and Derivatives Association overhauled the standard CDS contract definitions in 2014 to include a new “governmental intervention credit event” to cover exactly this sort of eventuality (one of the reasons for the overhaul was a fiasco surrounding the CDS of Dutch bank SNS Reaal the previous year, where swap holders received no payout even after the government zeroed its subordinated bonds).
The problem is that bank capital structures are rather more complicated than just being split into “senior” and “subordinated” bonds. There are multiple tiers of debt. And for the purposes of subordinated CDS, it is the Tier 2 bonds that matter.
This is because AT1 bonds, which banks only first started issuing around a decade ago, have a number of structural features that make them incompatible with CDS. For example, their perpetual maturities (which mean they never have to be repaid) clash with the requirement in standard CDS contracts that the relevant bonds have a maximum maturity of 30 years.
This distinction did not matter the first time that AT1 bonds were written down in Europe — in the case of Banco Popular in 2017 — because regulators zeroed the Spanish bank’s Tier 2 bonds in tandem. This led to a full payout for those who had bought CDS protection on Banco Popular’s subordinated bonds.
In the case of Credit Suisse, however, Swiss authorities left its Tier 2 bonds completely unscathed (rather miraculously, given that the Tier 2 debt had an incredibly similar writedown clause to the Swiss bank’s AT1 bonds).&nbsp;
With the Tier 2 bonds unimpaired, it seemed logical that there would be no payout on Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS contracts.
Or so you might have thought.
The first hint that all might not be as it seems comes from the fact that among the supporting documents in this week’s question to the DC is the offering circular for a £250mn subordinated bond that Credit Suisse’s US subsidiary issued in the year 2000.
Students of banking M&amp;A history may be interested to discover that these bonds were issued to fund the acquisition of US investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, back when an expansionary Credit Suisse First Boston was trying to make deeper inroads into the US junk bond market:
Crucially, however, this bond matured back in 2020. How can debt that no longer exists have any bearing on Credit Suisse’s CDS contracts in the here and now?
The answer lies in one of the many ways that bank capital structures have become even more complex as the result of the global regulatory framework introduced following the 2008 financial crisis.
On top of the standard capital requirements, globally significant banks also need to have a certain amount of bonds that can be easily written down in a crisis, not-so-catchily known as “total loss-absorbing capacity”. To fill up these buckets, banks began issuing a new tier of bonds that ranked between senior and Tier 2.
In the EU, banks mostly opted for so-called contractual subordination, where bonds are issued from the same entity and their contracts specify different orders of priority. Rather than giving them the more logical name Tier 3 bonds, bankers christened this new class of debt with the rather oxymoronic moniker “senior non-preferred”.
In the UK and Switzerland, however, banks instead adopted structural subordination, where bonds are issued out of different entities to determine their order of priority. While traditional senior bonds were issued from the main banking entity, the new bonds were issued out of a holding company. The two classes of debt became colloquially known as “OpCo senior” and “HoldCo senior” respectively.
The shift created even more complexity for European bank CDS, with different contracts emerging to reference the differing ways the two tiers of senior debt were issued across the continent.
It means that for Swiss CDS, the distinction between bonds at the HoldCo and the OpCo matters. And Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS references Credit Suisse Group AG (the HoldCo) not Credit Suisse AG (the OpCo).
You would probably expect that the relevant bond for this contract (the “reference obligation” in CDS parlance) to be the Credit Suisse Tier 2 bond that escaped a writedown in March. And yet that bond’s offering memorandum makes clear that this bond is an obligation of Credit Suisse AG, not Credit Suisse Group AG:
At this stage it makes sense to turn to the “Standard Reference Obligation list” maintained by IHS Markit to get a definitive answer on the contract’s relevant bond. And lo and behold, it lists the £250mn bond issued in 2000 that matured in 2020:
A quick check of the bond’s prospectus shows that in contrast to the Tier 2 bond, it was guaranteed by the same entity that the subordinated CDS references, Credit Suisse Group:
While it might seem deeply weird for CDS to reference a bond that no longer exists, ISDA’s standard CDS definitions do allow for this possibility, with the concept of a “prior reference obligation” for situations where no reference obligation is outstanding.
So, incredibly, it could well be the bond we need to look most closely at in determining whether there has been a CDS default.
So far, so strange.
But you could be forgiven for still wondering what relevance this legacy bond has to Credit Suisse’s AT1 wipeout. After all, it goes without saying that a bond that was repaid nearly three years ago was not written down as part of the UBS merger.
The next clue lies in the fact that the DC has not only been asked to rule on whether a governmental intervention credit event has occurred at Credit Suisse Group. The question submitted to the panel has a supplementary query:
“The Eligible Market Participant who submitted the question noted that in order to determine the DC Question the EMEA DC would need to determine whether the AT1 bonds were Not Subordinated to the Reference Obligation or the Prior Reference Obligation and asks the EMEA DC to consider this point in connection with the DC Question.”
This is relevant because it is not only a default on the specific “reference obligation” that leads to a CDS payout. The swaps should also be triggered if the borrower defaults on debt that ranks at the same level or higher (or, to use CDS parlance, debt that is “not subordinated to the reference obligation”).
If the AT1 bonds that were zeroed were deemed to rank pari passu with the £250mn subordinated bond that matured in 2020, that may be enough to trigger the swaps.
On the surface, this does not appear to be the case. The form of legacy bank capital that Credit Suisse issued in the year 2000 was colloquially known as “lower tier 2”. In the order of priority that makes up a bank’s capital structure, it follows that “tier 1” ranks behind “tier 2”.
And yet, in the 2020 maturity bond’s terms and conditions there is no reference to it being “tier 2” debt. The bond’s terms only set out that they are generic “subordinated obligations”. Unsurprisingly, there is no reference to the bond’s ranking in relation to AT1 debt, given that these securities did not yet exist when the bonds were issued in 2000.
The hedge funds that are wagering on a payout are betting on the fact that, while market participants generally understand that the subordinated bond issued in 2000 ranked ahead of the AT1s, there is not anything making that explicit in the documents relevant to a CDS decision.
In this logic, there is an amusing echo of the debate between Credit Suisse’s AT1 holders arguing that their debt was commonly understood to rank ahead of the bank’s common equity (which paradoxically was not zeroed in the merger and received $3bn) and sceptical observers telling them that this was never actually enshrined in the documents.
The final piece of the puzzle is a New York court decision from 1918, which FT Alphaville understands has been submitted to the DC as part of a belt and braces approach to proving that perpetual bonds are still legally considered debt (the ruling deals with a “perpetual debenture” issued in 1901, a sort of early 20th century version of an AT1 bond).
Let’s imagine for the sake of argument that this gambit works. The DC agrees that there has indeed been a governmental intervention credit event in respect to Credit Suisse Group’s subordinated CDS. What then?
CDS contracts do not all pay out the same amount when they are triggered. In most instances, an auction of the relevant bonds is held to determine what the loss to bondholders has been and to compensate them accordingly (for example, an auction that valued the bonds at 25 cents on the dollar would lead to a 75 cent payout on the CDS).
Given that the subordinated bond Credit Suisse issued in 2000 has already been repaid and its other bonds that are eligible for a CDS auction were not impaired in the UBS merger, you might assume there is little reward in store for those betting on a surprise CDS default.
This is where the hedge funds betting on a payout are banking on the sharp moves higher in interest rates over the past year coming to their aid, however.
Credit Suisse Group has a bond outstanding that is trading at around 65 cents on the dollar, purely as a function of the dramatic change in underlying rates since it was issued at the end of 2021 (the bond in question has a skimpy 0.625 per cent coupon and a decade-long 2033 maturity, making it particularly sensitive to interest rate changes).
While this is one of the so-called “HoldCo senior” bonds we discussed earlier, CDS contracts explicitly allow for bonds that are more senior than the reference obligation to be submitted into an auction. In the event that Credit Suisse’s subordinated CDS is deemed to have triggered, the hedge funds stand to bag a tidy 35 cent pay out.
That’s the trade as FT Alphaville understands it. Essentially, these two funds think the ambiguity over the ranking of a dead bond is enough to turn the AT1 wipeout into a CDS payout.
The big question remains: will it work?¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The logic behind it all may at times seem counterintuitive and faintly ridiculous, but then CDS decisions are frequently counterintuitive and faintly ridiculous. The members of the DC are not supposed to rule on how market participants intended the contracts to behave, but on their strict legal definitions, unintended quirks and all.
The DC accepted the question late on Friday and will hold their first discussion on the matter later today, so the panel certainly thinks it is at the very least worthy of debate.
It is also worth noting that there are serious players involved. FourSixThree and Diameter are both distressed debt specialists whose principals have extensive experience trading CDS. They have also enlisted a heavyweight law firm in Kramer Levin to support of their cause.
One thing that does strike us, however, is that there are several steps that the DC needs to go along with for a payout to occur. This means the trade has multiple points of failure.
For example, while the four corners of the 2000 vintage bond’s offering memorandum do not contain an indication that it is a Tier 2 bond that ranks ahead of the AT1, the order of hierarchy can be found in other publicly available documents. This document Credit Suisse issued in 2019 explicitly states that the 2000 bond has a “Tier 2” ranking, while also stating the AT1 bonds’ “position in subordination hierarchy in liquidation” is behind the Tier 2.
If the DC does not agree with the notion that the AT1 bonds are “not subordinate” to the “prior reference obligation”, then the whole trade falls apart. Athanassios Diplas, one of the architects of the modern CDS auction, has tweeted that this could be an “uphill battle”:
Whatever the outcome though, one thing is for certain: the trade is delightfully weird and fun.
And FT Alphaville is strongly in favour of weird and fun trades, whether or not they are ultimately successful.

Australian lawmakers call for sweeping changes to crypto rules,Cryptocurrencies,"Australia should create a new regulatory regime for crypto assets to bring business onshore and help it compete with Singapore and the UK, a report commissioned by parliament has recommended.
The extensive study, published on Wednesday, called on lawmakers to make wide-ranging changes to encourage more crypto business to the country, and to smooth legal pathways that prevent companies from accessing normal banking services.
The report underscores tensions among policymakers worldwide as they try to balance investor protection with grabbing a share of the fast-growing crypto industry.
Among the changes it recommended included a new type of market licence for crypto exchanges, a clear framework for custody of assets and new company rules that covered new projects in decentralised finance, or DeFi. The report, commissioned in March, is expected to provide the framework for domestic crypto legislation next year, probably after an election.
“What we don’t want to do is put a new coat on an old hook,” said Andrew Bragg, senator for New South Wales, who chaired the committee that compiled the report. “There’s a strong anti-competitive element in Australia where the incumbents don’t like innovation and their solution is to push new ideas into old regulatory frameworks that were designed for something else.”
“The agenda here is to try and be as good as Singapore or the UK. We want to be a world-leading jurisdiction for cryptocurrency,” he told the Financial Times.
Bragg, a former regulator, added that he was confident of getting support for his recommendations.
Australian consumers are growing increasingly comfortable with owning cryptocurrencies as their value has boomed in the past two years.
A study by YouGov for crypto exchange Swyftx last month found that more than a third of all Australians under 50 either own or have owned digital assets such as bitcoin and ethereum. That puts them among the largest users of crypto assets in the OECD group, the report said. Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), one of Australia’s largest pension funds, has also said it may make small investments in the sector.
That growth, however, has been accompanied by growing concern among authorities that many crypto businesses operate in offshore jurisdictions. Among the local companies that have sought regulatory approval abroad include Sydney-based Independent Reserve and Melbourne’s CoinJar, which both secured licences in Singapore and the UK respectively last month.
“The more that happens offshore, the more parts will migrate offshore . . . especially if they can’t get back incentives in Australia. It’s quite strategically important to us to have this capability onshore and be a strong digital economy,” Bragg said.
Asher Tan, chief executive of CoinJar, said his company’s decision to open in the UK was more practical. “It was mostly because it was a larger market,” he said.
Bragg’s report recommended a new type of market permit for crypto exchanges and would cover capital adequacy and responsible person tests. It also suggested rules that cover so-called decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), a loose company whose rules are automated or developed by consensus among the members.
“DAOs do not clearly fall within any of Australia’s existing company structures. Legal liability for [token holders] for these organisations is currently unclear, and this regulatory uncertainty is preventing the establishment of projects of significant scale in Australia,” the report said.
It pointed to standards in the US state of Wyoming as a potential template."
Binance US walks away from proposed $1bn deal for Voyager Digital assets,Cryptocurrencies,"Binance US is abandoning its proposed $1bn acquisition of assets belonging to Voyager Digital, bringing to an end the exchange’s long-running effort to purchase the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets.
Binance US — the American arm of crypto conglomerate Binance — has sought for months to convince regulators to give the green light to the acquisition. Its efforts have run into several road blocks, including opposition from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, an inter-agency panel that screens proposed acquisitions for national security risks.
Voyager Digital tweeted on Tuesday that it received a letter from Binance US advising of the termination. It described the decision as “disappointing”, and said the reorganisation plan in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings allowed for a direct distribution of cash and cryptocurrency to customers.
The collapse of the proposed deal represents yet another blow to the crypto industry’s efforts to establish itself in the US amid a crackdown on digital assets by American regulators.
“Any time you have a company that says it wants to go in one direction and then it has to pull the plug, that’s not good,” said one Washington lobbyist who was previously approached for a job with Binance.
Earlier this year, Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao said the company intended to pull back on potential investments in the US as a result of a regulatory push from several American watchdogs that have trained their sights on crypto business.
Binance has long claimed that its American affiliate licenses its technology but remains an independent entity. However, links between the two exist, including Zhao, who remains the ultimate beneficial owner behind Binance US.
Earlier this year US regulators sued Binance, alleging much of its reported trading volume and profit came from access to US customers, undermining the group’s longstanding claims that both entities are separate.
Last month, the Financial Times revealed Binance hid substantial ties to China for several years, including an office in Shanghai and one Chinese bank that was used to pay some employee salaries.
Binance US said the “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment”."
City lobby groups warn UK Treasury on crypto plans,Cryptocurrencies,"Some of the most powerful lobby groups in traditional finance have warned the UK government that its plans to regulate the cryptocurrency industry could offer legitimacy to a market that remains fraught with risks for consumers.
The Treasury has been gathering feedback on its February proposals for rules on crypto, with City Minister Andrew Griffith promising “clear, effective, timely regulation” that would “strengthen our position as a world leader in fintech, unlock growth and boost innovation”.
Politicians want to bring the trading, issuance and lending of digital assets into a regulatory framework similar to that applied to stocks and bonds. The crypto market in the UK is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority solely for compliance with money laundering rules, although the FCA will soon also be able to police adverts.
Regulation offers, “to some extent, unearned trust with customers”, ICAEW, the professional body for the UK’s Chartered Accountants, said in one of several dozens of responses to the Treasury’s consultation on the plans, which formally closed at the end of April.
“By expanding the perimeter and authorising firms for crypto-related activities, consumers might be justified in concluding that the perceived risks that are known about cryptoassets have been to some extent addressed or managed,” the accountants stressed, voicing a concern that has long been aired in regulatory circles.
UK-based holders of cryptocurrency lost hundreds of millions to fraud last year, while others have suffered sharp falls in the value of their holdings or lost out as crypto firms imploded, most dramatically Bahamas-based FTX.
Treasury officials have described the UK’s approach as “more nimble and proportionate” than the EU’s incoming Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation.
The International Regulatory Strategy Group, which represents finance lobby group TheCityUK and The City of London Corporation, said the definitions in the proposals needed to be “much more precise”.
The government’s proposed definition of cryptoassets covers not only cryptocurrencies and tokenised versions of “traditional” financial assets but also potentially any encrypted information that could be considered as having “value”.
“Virtually every electronic system . . . relies on encryption to transmit data packets which arguably have ‘value’,” the IRSG said. “We would strongly suggest that further consideration is given as to whether such a wide definition is appropriate.”
The Chartered Institute of Taxation and Association of Taxation Technicians said its members were “finding it increasingly difficult to deal with crypto transactions in practice”. The tax lobby group called on the Treasury to address the tax treatment of cryptoasset transactions.
HM Revenue &amp; Customs last month announced a separate consultation on taxing crypto assets and other decentralised finance activity so that the treatments better align “with the underlying economic substance” of the activities.
The cryptocurrency industry was broadly supportive in its responses to the Treasury’s initiative, but called for refinements.
CryptoUK, which describes itself as the sector’s “self regulatory trade association”, asked for an “indicative time” for how long it would take crypto businesses to be authorised under the new regime.
Many companies have complained bitterly about the pace of the FCA’s system to process applications to join its register, and the regulator has turned down more than 80 per cent of applicants.
CryptoUK also urged the Treasury to ensure that disclosure rules did not “put disproportionate liability on trading venues”.
The UK has not set an implementation date for the crypto package, which is part of the broader swath of Edinburgh reforms designed to reinvigorate a financial services sector that suffered heavy losses in the aftermath of Brexit.

"Clearing, crypto and wooing big investors",Cryptocurrencies,"Hello and welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we’re taking a look at traditional finance’s approach to crypto.
A common refrain is that fund managers have not been put off crypto by the collapse of coin prices, the endless stream of bad news and the crackdown by US authorities.
To a return-hungry fund manager, crypto is once again an attractive proposition. Shares and bonds are still struggling for direction after another uninspiring quarter and commodities are becalmed. Meanwhile bitcoin has jumped by more than half since its lows only three months ago to more than $30,000 as fears over inflation ease.
But this isn’t a market investors are jumping into with abandon. It is very thinly traded — crypto data provider Kaiko last month estimated that the depth of the market, or ability to trade easily close to the prevailing market price, in bitcoin has dropped 50 per cent since FTX’s collapse in November. Things have improved slightly but Kaiko found little evidence of fresh sources of liquidity.
What traditional investors need, according to Arnab Sen, chief executive of UK marketplace GFO-X, is a “safe, regulated venue where large financial institutions can trade at scale, while keeping their clients’ assets protected”.
His comments came in the week GFO-X teamed up with the London Stock Exchange Group’s LCH clearing house to clear digital asset derivatives in Paris. They are not alone. Nomura’s digital assets subsidiary Laser Digital last month invested in ClearToken, a clearing house for private over-the-counter digital assets deals. Komainu, a crypto custody provider, has set up a crypto collateral management service.
Services such as LCH DigitalAssetClear, ClearToken and Komainu are pitching themselves as trusted sources for investors, banks, brokers, market makers and custodians.
Dip a toe into crypto waters and reasons to be cautious quickly surface. Many investors cannot hold crypto tokens, either by investor mandate or regulation. Putting money in a crypto exchange is something of a leap of faith. You may or may not be facilitating money laundering or trading against sanctions-hit entities. Your assets may not be as safe as the company promised. In a bankruptcy filing your money may well go into a pot alongside everyone else’s claims. Then there are issues such as cold wallets and private keys . . . the list goes on.
On the other hand clearing houses and collateral management are well-tested concepts. A clearing house sits between a buyer and seller, insulating the market from a default and overseeing the transfer of deals from one owner to another. Komainu keeps the customers’ collateral but lends it out for trading on exchanges via a series of tri-party agreements. Risk managers can be more reassured that these projects come in a regulated and well-tested wrapper.
It sounds dull but offers a sharp professional contrast to the amateur, do-it-yourself efforts of crypto. Ethereum this week upgraded its system to give holders of ether more flexibility to withdraw their assets when they wish.
Yet Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, was among those warning that it could take an initial “15 days to several weeks” before it could fully process requests from users to withdraw their ether from a staking programme. It will mainly depend on the size of the withdrawal and how loaded the Ethereum network is, Binance added.
What’s on offer are two competing visions of how the crypto market should work on a daily basis.
At present crypto customers largely have to pre-fund trading of crypto tokens, either with cash or other crypto tokens. Exchanges offer customers leverage and can draw in buyers but they can exit just as fast. Using tokens based on a value that can rapidly change doesn’t make for a deep, stable and liquid market.
In traditional markets to lubricate trading there are windows of temporary credit, such as the period for a customer to meet margin calls or a two-day window for settlement. It’s not easy to marry the two concepts.
“If you go back to basics, clearing on a blockchain doesn’t work. It assumes you have the cash,” said Ben Stephens, chief executive of ClearToken.
Moreover those credit windows are offered uniformly to all. In crypto markets credit is much more at the discretion of the exchange, as it acts as trade facilitator, broker and custodian. One has to trust that it is not trading against the customer.
US charges against FTX and Binance have alleged crypto exchanges are far more centralised than supposed. Wholesale financial markets, with independent clearing houses and custodians, are more decentralised than painted. Fund managers and banks are not comfortable with the co-mingling of roles, or holding so much capital in a black box.
The unknown question is the extent to which an institutional, perhaps over-the-counter market, is dependent on centralised crypto exchanges for a reference price. That could leave the market as exposed to thin or manipulative trading as the current system.
But the building blocks for a two-tier crypto market are emerging, which may turn it into something resembling the vast foreign exchange market. Retail investors can find an easily available money changer — although the rate on offer is dreadful — but the substantial business takes place elsewhere, in a radically different world.
But that is years away. For now the challenge is to persuade big investors to join in.

Ethereum undertook its so-called Shanghai software upgrade, which allows holders of ether to stake their assets without being forced to lock them up for a set period of time. Optimists suggested it could unlock interest from institutional investors. The much-touted “Merge” on Ethereum last September also promised to prepare the ground for more use of crypto technology in mainstream finance. It hasn’t.
Lawyers for FTX told a US bankruptcy court that the company had so far recovered $7.3bn in “distributable assets” at the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.
Bitcoin’s resurgence this year has attracted many theories. Michael Novogratz, chief executive and founder of crypto financial group Galaxy Digital, suggested it was the collapse of several midsized US banks and a wave of US enforcement actions that had “energised” the investor base, according to a Bloomberg report.
“Crypto started as the little person’s revolution — they didn’t trust governments,” he said. “You’re picking a fight with a crypto community that loves this technology and believes it almost with religious fervour.”
What a difference a lawsuit makes. Last month the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Binance of operating illegally in the country and its trading volume and profitability had come from “extensive solicitation of and access to” US customers.
Research from Kaiko shows volume sank in the five days between Binance ending most zero-fee trading in bitcoin and then the impact of the CFTC lawsuit.

Coinbase considers US future as crackdown rolls on,Cryptocurrencies,"Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT’s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we’re taking a look at Coinbase’s threats to leave the US.&nbsp;
I may have taken time off over Easter but it appears the US regulators busy cracking down on crypto did not.
On Monday Bittrex and its co-founder and former chief executive William Shihara were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency in the US.&nbsp;
The charges come only weeks after Bittrex said it was packing up in the US, lamenting that “regulatory requirements are often unclear and enforced without appropriate discussion or input”.&nbsp;
It’s not the only exchange contemplating life outside the US as the SEC’s prosecution of crypto shows little sign of slowing. San Francisco-based Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong, who at best has a rocky relationship with American regulators, again threatened to do the same during a trip to London this week.
“Anything is on the table,” he said, promising that Coinbase is prepared to relocate should the US keep up what it sees as undue pressure on crypto companies.
During an interview with me this week, Coinbase’s vice-president of international and business development Nana Murugesan doubled down on its stance.
“From day one the mission has been increasing economic freedom in the world. If we don’t feel like we can do that, something will have to change,” he told me at Coinbase’s office in the City of London.
Perhaps as a precaution and to increase its global footprint, Coinbase received a licence on Thursday to operate in Bermuda. The blog post described Bermuda as a jurisdiction “long known for a high level of rigour, transparency, compliance and co-operation”.&nbsp;
Coinbase hasn’t committed to moving headquarters, but it would still be a huge moment if it did leave the US. It is listed there, on Nasdaq, and its management has deep roots in the country. Armstrong, for example, has a (very big and desirable) property there.
But even if they did walk away from the US, would it actually matter?
At an appearance in Washington this week Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, appeared little concerned with details like where someone is based.
“I’ve been around finance for over 40 years . . . I’ve never seen a field that’s so non-compliant with laws written by Congress and affirmed by the courts. This is largely, unfortunately for the investing public, a non-compliant field,” he said.
And Coinbase is overwhelmingly dependent on the States for business. Last year revenues from the US were nearly $2.7bn. The rest of the world totalled just over $500mn, and no other individual country accounted for more than 10 per cent of its total revenue.
In 2021, when the world battled against a historic pandemic called “fear of missing out”, induced by record-high crypto prices, Coinbase’s turnover from US customers was $6.3bn and only $1.5bn from customers located elsewhere.
The charges brought against Binance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission suggest regulators don’t like crypto exchanges helping US businesses to move their activity abroad either.
Going after people like Binance’s Changpeng Zhao or Terra Network’s Do Kwon is also a reminder that US regulators don’t care where a company is based if they think American investors have been harmed or exposed to undue risk. And if authorities bring criminal charges, then US citizens can be extradited, as FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried knows all too well.
“[The US] try to extend their jurisdiction and reach beyond the territoriality of the United States to the extent that US investors are impacted, so to the extent that people try to move crypto offshore, I don’t think it will chill the regulatory wheel,” said Mark Kornfeld, shareholder at law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney PC.&nbsp;

European lawmakers reached final agreement on Mica, the EU’s flagship legislative package designed to oversee the digital assets space. Mattias Levin of the European Commission’s Digital Finance Unit said: “This is the first comprehensive piece of regulation of crypto assets in the world, and we hope and trust that other regulators will follow suit.”
Auction house Sotheby’s will sell off the collection of non-fungible tokens owned by Three Arrows Capital, the crypto hedge fund that collapsed in spectacular fashion last summer. “Collections are often representative of the time and place from which they were formed, telling a unique story through their artworks,” the press release stated. Indeed.
In the latest saga facing Binance US’s proposed acquisitions of assets belonging to bankrupt Voyager Digital, a court filing this week paved the way for some aspects of the deal to be agreed. The deal, however, is still under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is screening the proposal for any potential national security risks.
The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is the latest high-profile investor in now-bankrupt exchange FTX to reckon with its decision to jump on the crypto bandwagon. The organisation, which is responsible for pensions among Ontario’s educators, said it was unlikely to dabble in digital assets again. Check out the story by my colleagues Josephine Cumbo and Arash Massoudi.
Gary Gensler’s stance on crypto is clear enough, but during his appearance on the Hill this week, the SEC chief encountered stiff opposition from one of crypto’s biggest American advocates, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN).&nbsp;
“Your regulatory style lacks flexibility and nuance, and as a result, you’ve been an incompetent cop on the beat, doing nothing to protect everyday Americans and pushing American firms into the hands of the Chinese Communist party.”&nbsp;
The long-running theme — reiterated by Brian Armstrong and a few politicians this week — is that the US risks losing its slice of an innovative, revolutionary industry as a blizzard of enforcement and lack of clarity on rules drives out business.
Yet America’s share of crypto spot trading volume, on exchanges at least, has hovered unremarkably around 10 per cent since the start of last year, according to analytics platform CCData.
Long story short, crypto’s threats to leave the US remain a lot of bark but no bite.

Coinbase trading volumes fall as regulatory uncertainty weighs,Cryptocurrencies,"Coinbase has suffered a further drop in trading volumes even though the price of bitcoin has rallied, raising the stakes for the exchange as it tries to fend off a probe from the US markets regulator while launching its own legal action.
Monthly trading volume at the Nasdaq-listed group has fallen to $26.8bn so far in April, on track for its lowest level in 16 months, despite bitcoin surging and crypto traders shifting funds away from US banks.
Bitcoin and ether, the two most actively-traded crypto tokens, have risen 64 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, this year as confidence has returned to a market badly shaken by a credit crisis in 2022.
The decline in activity on Coinbase deepens the squeeze on the San Francisco-based group, which relies on fees generated from trading volume for the bulk of its revenues. Shares in the group have fallen by 17 per cent in the past month as hopes have faded for a rebound after a poor 2022.
It is also the focus of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible securities laws violation, and last month received a Wells notice from the SEC, a notification that the regulator was considering potential enforcement action.
On Monday, Coinbase hit back with its own lawsuit against the SEC, asking a federal court to force the regulator to provide clearer guidance on the rules governing the crypto market.
“Market sentiment has certainly been affected by regulatory action in the US,” said Varun Paul, director of market infrastructure at blockchain platform Fireblocks, who previously spent 14 years at the Bank of England. “This legal uncertainty is likely adversely impacting crypto companies walking a regulatory tightrope.”
US regulatory authorities have been cracking down on illicit crypto activity this year with a host of lawsuits and settlements, prompting fears in the industry that crypto business will either leave the US, move offshore or migrate to alternative trading venues.
Coinbase management has also refused to rule out leaving the United States. The exchange reached a $100mn settlement with New York regulators for alleged anti money laundering failures in January.
Coinbase’s trading volumes in the past three months have also been lower than that of Uniswap, a little-known trading network that allows users to buy and sell digital assets directly with each other and bypass intermediaries that might charge fees, like an exchange.
Data analytics platform CCData found that Uniswap facilitated almost $69bn in trading volume in March, in comparison to Coinbase’s $49bn.
On social media earlier this month, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said the exchange also used Uniswap to fulfil some of its customer services. The DeFi platform has also facilitated more trading volume than several Coinbase rivals, including OKX and Kraken.
“I think all US centralised exchanges are losing or likely to lose to decentralised exchanges (or to foreign exchanges) due to the US regulatory crackdown,” said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan managing director focused on alternatives and digital assets. “This is likely to be a slow moving background trend rather than an abrupt shift.”"
Deribit sets up crypto exchange battle with push into free trading,Cryptocurrencies,"Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit is launching free trading of bitcoin and other tokens, setting up a fresh price war among digital asset exchanges as they seek to re-emerge after a bruising year for the industry.
The Panama-based group, the world’s biggest crypto options exchange, will begin direct trading in three of the most popular cryptocurrency pairs from next week and waive the fees.
Its move underscores how competition is heating up among crypto exchanges as they try to entice institutional investors keen to get into a rising market after the crash in digital asset prices last year and the failure of industry bellwether FTX. Around 90 per cent of Deribit’s customers are institutional clients.
Popular coins such as bitcoin and ether have outperformed assets such as stocks and commodities this year, rising 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.
It also comes a month after Binance, the world’s largest marketplace for crypto trading, ended a six-month foray into zero-fee trading, a move that accelerated its market share.
Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said the exchange’s move into spot trading was driven by customer demand.
“You would have to buy ether on Binance instead of Deribit,” he said, adding: “If you want to convert $5mn [into bitcoin], for example, we would have to tell you to go elsewhere, which is terrible customer service.”
“In order to have a proper derivatives offering you also need to have spot,” he added.
Big-name money managers have continued to explore digital assets and monetise investor interest in the past year, even as the industry suffered a confidence crisis and many companies failed.
“Serious institutional players remain committed and, in fact, see the open space after the demise of multiple crypto-native players as an opportunity.” Bernstein analysts wrote this week.
Deribit will offer free trading in pairs of ether and bitcoin, and ether and bitcoin against the stablecoin USDC, which is operated by Circle. US-listed Coinbase charges up to 0.6 per cent for a trade, for example.
Strijers added that trading on the three pairs would remain free to trade “for the foreseeable future” and that future tokens that might be added would have a charge.
The market share of Binance soared by a fifth after launching fee-free trading in 13 coins and at reached nearly two-thirds of total volume on the exchange, according to data provider Kaiko. However the exchange’s lead fell back after it reintroduced charges.
Deribit added that it was looking to use spot trading as an entry for customers to trade options and futures. Strijers said this would “service our existing client base and potentially attract some new clients who then . . . will also trade options, futures or perpetual [futures]”.
Deribit was founded in 2016 and is backed by investors including crypto venture firm 10T Holdings and trading firm Akuna Capital."
European Central Bank official warns of ‘gaps’ in forthcoming crypto rules,Cryptocurrencies,"The EU’s incoming regulations for crypto assets will allow some of the industry’s biggest players, including exchange Binance, to escape stricter supervision and need to be overhauled, a senior European Central Bank official has warned.
Elizabeth McCaul, a member of the ECB’s supervisory board, warned in a blog on Wednesday of “gaps in the framework” for regulating crypto markets and said traditional approaches to financial market oversight might not work.
McCaul’s view reflects growing concern in Europe over the region’s ability to oversee the crypto industry, which has been marred by several high-profile scandals in recent months including last year’s collapse of exchange FTX.
In a challenge to Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading exchange and which claims to have no formal headquarters, McCaul said such companies posed “challenges for our current regulatory and supervisory approaches”.
“No jurisdiction should allow entities to run their business without disclosing their legal status and who is responsible for the business,” she said. “Even firms that claim to have no headquarters, such as Binance, need to be ‘supervisable’.”
Her comment is a further sign of mounting regulatory pressure on Binance after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a lawsuit last month against the exchange, accusing it of illegally serving US clients. The CFTC also cited internal communications that it said showed Binance knew the platform facilitated potentially illegal activities.
Binance claimed the complaint “appears to contain an incomplete recitation of facts”, adding that it did not agree with the “characterisation of many of the issues alleged in the complaint”.
The CFTC’s lawsuit came two days before the Financial Times revealed Binance hid substantial ties to China for several years.
The EU has drawn up an extensive set of rules, known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (Mica) regulation, due to come into force in 2024. McCaul said she was proud the EU was “taking the first steps globally to provide for oversight of the crypto world”.
Mica will bolster governance, segregation of customer funds and external audit requirements, she said, while warning “certain areas still need further strengthening”.
For crypto asset service providers to be considered significant under Mica and therefore supervised by the European Banking Authority in co-operation with the ECB, they must have at least 15mn active users in Europe — a threshold McCaul said was likely to miss Binance and FTX, before its collapse. Smaller crypto providers will be supervised by national EU authorities.
She suggested the threshold be adjusted to account for different business types and be measured “at group level rather than an individual entity level”. Stricter rules and enhanced supervision should apply to crypto groups classed as significant, which they do not under Mica, she added.
Crypto groups often have opaque structures criss-crossing many national borders. McCaul said regulators needed to supervise them at a group level to identify conflicts of interest and “opportunities for regulatory arbitrage”.
Her concerns build on those already expressed by other top European regulators. The ECB’s chair of supervision Andrea Enria had warned that crypto platforms posed a “huge consumer protection issue” because they did not respect national borders. EBA chair José Manuel Campa praised Mica but admitted there were blind spots in the package.
Binance is also seeking to convince US regulators to greenlight a deal that would allow Binance US, the company’s US affiliate, to purchase the assets of Voyager Digital, a crypto company that went bankrupt last year. The deal is under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government agency that determines if overseas investments present national security risks.
Binance said in a statement: “Over the years, Binance has been vocal about the need for effective and appropriate regulation. Mica is a welcome and pragmatic step in the right direction on this, harmonizing requirements across the EU and creating a single market for crypto.”"
Gibraltar court freezes crypto assets in hunt for missing $43mn,Cryptocurrencies,"Liquidators for Globix, a collapsed cryptocurrency trader, have secured a court order that freezes digital assets and forces crypto exchanges to hand over customer information as they search for $43mn of missing funds.
A court injunction in Gibraltar earlier this month ordered Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, to halt attempts to move assets from several Globix-linked crypto wallets.
The court also demanded that rival exchanges including Crypto.com, Bitstamp and Kraken reveal the identities behind certain crypto wallets associated with the Globix platform, according to the order, which has been seen by the Financial Times. Insolvency lawyers are looking for around $43mn, according to a person familiar with the search.
The asset injunction has threatened to undermine Gibraltar’s ambitions to become a world-leading jurisdiction that properly monitors digital asset businesses. The British Overseas Territory passed regulations for crypto in early 2018, making it one of the first jurisdictions in the world to write rules for the fledgling market.
Globix was trying to carve a niche in crypto investing by letting investors choose automated trading strategies to pick attractively valued tokens, but was caught out by the unprecedented crypto downturn last summer.
Damian Carreras, the company’s sole shareholder and director, is a Gibraltarian citizen while the majority of Globix’s investors are in Gibraltar, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Some occupied positions of influence in legal and political circles and at least one investor was a sitting member of the Gibraltar Parliament, one of the people said.
“A fair number of the investors knew each other,” said an individual familiar with the matter, who added the majority of missing funds were held in tether, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar and widely used to move funds between sovereign money and crypto.
The injunction, which was granted on April 13, further added that any other person with knowledge of the order who helped or permitted the respondents breach its terms might be held in contempt of court.
Following the failure of FTX in the Bahamas — and several major crypto firms in Singapore — financial centres around the world are wrestling with the reputational fallout that comes with controversial crypto collapses.
Globix was not licensed by local regulators but its fate has called into question whether the architects of Gibraltar’s crypto ambitions can adequately identify risks to consumers.
One individual, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, questioned how experienced investors familiar with financial services could have invested in an unlicensed investment vehicle. Another individual, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, added: “It should have been regulated in Gibraltar.”
The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission told the FT it took a “proactive approach to perimeter issues”, and worked with relevant authorities to “help safeguard consumers and the reputation of Gibraltar”.
Globix closed its doors to investors in June last year as a crisis of confidence gripped the crypto market, causing several major crypto tokens including bitcoin to lose more than half their value and several once-prominent firms to go bankrupt. Carreras voluntarily put Globix into liquidation last month after a prolonged period of struggling to pay investors.
Last June, the same month Globix investors were locked out of the system, Gibraltar was placed on a “grey list” by the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organisation that leads global action to combat financial crime. Countries placed on this list are identified as having strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Government of Gibraltar said the case “demonstrates the need for firms to be licensed and supervised in order to provide adequate standards of consumer protection”, which it adds was the “overriding objective” in Gibraltar’s crypto regulations.
Carreras told the FT Globix was “the victim of cyber crime, and theft of our fund, which we have tried to recover”.
Submissions made to Gibraltar courts claim a Globix funding wallet was active until late September 2022, well after investors were locked out of their accounts. Moreover, roughly $18mn was transferred to Binance between May 2021 and September 2022. Binance said it complied with all lawful information requests.
According to two people familiar with the matter, Carreras had been reluctant to co-operate with the appointed joint liquidators, Adrian Hyde, Joanne Wild and Brian Simpson of corporate recovery specialist firm Begbies Traynor.
Carreras said he was co-operating with the assistance of legal advisers, and declined to provide more information due to the ongoing legal process.
“It’s an impossible standard to expect a regulator to be omniscient and know what every single Gibraltarian is investing in, especially if a company isn’t regulated or established within the jurisdiction,” said one person familiar with financial services in Gibraltar."
Global banking regulator urges toughest capital rules for crypto,Cryptocurrencies,"Global regulators are calling for cryptocurrencies to carry the toughest bank capital rules of any asset, arguing that requirements for holding bitcoin and similar tokens should be far higher than those for conventional stocks and bonds.
Banks with exposure to volatile cryptocurrencies should face stricter capital requirements to reflect the higher risks, said the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the world’s most powerful banking standards-setter.
Its intervention came in a report released on Thursday as policymakers around the world step up plans to regulate the fast-emerging market.
The Basel committee acknowledged that while banks’ exposure to the nascent crypto industry was limited, “the growth of crypto assets and related services has the potential to raise financial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks”. Among the risks it cited included market and credit risk, fraud, hacking, money laundering and terrorist financing risk.
Some assets, such as stock tokens, would fit into modified existing rules on minimum capital standards for banks. Others, such as bitcoin, would face a new “conservative” prudential regime, it recommended.
Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets such as currencies — would also qualify for existing rules if they were fully reserved at all times, the committee said. Banks would have to monitor that this was “effective at all times”, it added.
All other crypto assets, including bitcoin and ethereum, would go into the new, more strenuous regime. The Basel committee proposed a risk weight of 1,250 per cent, in line with the toughest standards for banks’ exposures on riskier assets.
That would mean banks would in effect have to hold capital equal to the exposure they face, and be prepared if the value of the asset were worthless. A $100 exposure in bitcoin would result in a minimum capital requirement of $100, Basel said.
The standards would apply to assets created for decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but potential central bank digital currencies were outside the scope of the consultation, it added.
Bitcoin has risen 3 per cent today, while ethereum was up over 2 per cent.
The Basel proposals come as global regulators grapple with the rapid emergence of digital assets and mushrooming interest from investors. US authorities also want to take a more active role in supervising the $1.5tn cryptocurrency market because of concerns that a lack of oversight risks harming investors in the highly volatile and speculative industry.

Some bankers feel the Basel proposals go too far. “If we are going to impose a punitive weighting, what we are saying is we don’t want these assets in the banking system,” said a banking executive involved in the crypto space.
“We’ve all seen what happens when you drive activity out of a pretty well regulated system into the wild west . . . Do the regulators want the adults to do the business, or would they want the teenagers to do the business?”
State Street and Citigroup are among the banks that have indicated they are aiming to provide more crypto services to customers. Last week, UK-headquartered Standard Chartered announced a joint venture with BC Group, the Hong Kong-listed digital asset company, to establish a digital asset brokerage and exchange platform for clients across Europe.
Prudential rules set requirements on liquid assets and capital levels that a bank must set aside so it can wind down in an orderly way, without harming its customers or creating panic in the market.
Digital tokens that are based on traditional assets, such as shares, bonds, commodities and cash, would fit into the first category for crypto assets.However, they would have to have the same level of legal rights as the traditional asset, such as the right to a dividend or other cash flows some do not currently carry.
The consultation ends in September."
Industry slams UK proposal to treat crypto as gambling,Cryptocurrencies,"Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we’re taking a look at a call in Britain to treat crypto as gambling.
Crypto’s big story this week comes from London, where a cross-party group of politicians called on the UK government to abandon plans to regulate crypto and instead treat it as gambling.
The report, which described crypto assets as having “no intrinsic value” and having “no discernible social good”, has left the digital assets industry seething.
“It’s not helpful, I just don’t get who they’ve been listening to, to come to this conclusion,” Ian Taylor, board adviser at British lobbying group CryptoUK, told me over the phone. “I have spent so much time saying the technology brings a host of benefits across financial markets and then they’ve said the opposite is true.”&nbsp;
The Treasury select committee’s report comes at a delicate time for the future of crypto assets in the UK. The government has set itself the goal of establishing the UK as a “hub for crypto innovation”, corporate clichés be damned. It has done so in the wake of the EU’s recently agreed Mica framework for digital assets, setting London against Brussels, Paris, and other European capitals in the race for crypto supremacy.
Just last week Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, spoke at the FT’s crypto summit and said the government was “trying to make sure the UK is a really good place to do business if you’re trying to take advantage of this amazing world, the whole Web 3.0 that crypto can potentially be a really powerful and enabling technology within”.
Ultimately, that ambition could go up in smoke if crypto was relegated to just another form of gambling. The industry would fall under the remit of the UK’s 300-strong Gambling Commission instead of London’s premier financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.
“What an appalling backwards step this would be,” Nick Jones, co-founder and chief executive of digital assets firm Zumo, told me.
Ben Lee, a partner in Andersen LLP’s crypto team, also said the committee’s report was “conspicuously silent” on how crypto would be taxed, if it were treated as gambling.
“Winnings from gambling are generally tax free . . . HMRC has sought to educate investors that crypto assets are not tax free, and this may create uncertainty as to whether this position is still correct.”&nbsp;
Earlier this year, the Treasury confirmed that from 2024-25, self-assessment tax return forms would feature a standalone section for individuals and trusts which had disposed of crypto assets.
It’s important to remember that this is only a committee report and not government policy. Still, political winds and governments change, and calls to treat crypto as gambling may one day land on a government far less enthusiastic about digital assets.
“Look, the current government will most likely not change the policy course, however it is obliged to respond, but that doesn’t mean an incoming government won’t change their view and that’s very damaging for the work the industry is trying to do to establish itself in the UK,” Taylor said.
The committee’s conclusion raises one question, though: what should we consider crypto as, if the industry’s traditional selling points have failed?
Bitcoin has routinely been pitched as a hedge against inflation, but it lost more than 70 per cent of its value in last year’s crash and is yet to meaningfully recover; decentralised finance and NFTs were meant to unlock mainstream attention but trading has been flat for months; the argument that it was a ‘haven asset’ as US regional banks wobbled looks overdone as the crisis eases; advocates argue cryptocurrencies act as an emancipating financial force in emerging markets but only El Salvador and the Central African Republic have adopted it as legal tender.
So, what’s left? As I pointed out eight months ago, crypto needs a story to sell, and the onus is on the industry to tell us what that story should be.
What’s your take on the committee’s call to push crypto into the gambling world? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.&nbsp;
While the UK wrestles with its latest scheme to undermine project crypto hub, America’s crackdown on digital assets is pushing companies, money and trading offshore. Nasdaq-listed Coinbase and Gemini have stepped up plans to launch marketplaces outside the US, while offshore stablecoin provider Tether has seen its share of the market rise by a fifth since January. Check out my story here.
Alameda Research — FTX’s sister trading firm — is seeking to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars paid to individuals and firms including a venture capital vehicle owned by former UK chancellor George Osborne. Check out my colleague Mark Vandevelde’s story here.
Binance announced on Thursday it was no longer able to facilitate Australian dollar deposits for users due to “a decision made by our third-party payment service provider.” This is not the first time Binance has encountered payment issues with fiat currencies: earlier this year it announced the suspension of US dollar transfers without providing a reason for the decision. The industry behemoth has also ran into issues in the UK, when Paysafe, which provided deposit and withdrawal services to the exchange, ended its services.
My colleagues Ivan Levingston and George Hammond ran a story detailing how OpenAI boss Sam Altman is close to securing roughly $100mn in funding for his plan to use eyeball-scanning technology to create a “secure” global cryptocurrency called Worldcoin. Previous investors in the company include Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund and none other than Sam Bankman-Fried. A dystopian nightmare or benign use of technology? Check out the story here.
It should come as no surprise by now that the US has taken a zero-tolerance approach to perceived bad behaviour in the crypto sphere.
So much so that the industry has shared concerns that a greater crackdown on companies of systemic importance would deal a potentially fatal blow to the market.
Eun Young Choi, director of the Justice Department’s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, told my colleague Stefania Palma that the DoJ doesn’t share the same concerns.
If a company “has amassed a significant market share in part because they’re [flouting] US criminal law”, the DoJ cannot “be in a position where we give someone a pass because they’re saying ‘well, now we’ve grown too big to fail’”.&nbsp;
The amount of USDC tokens, the stablecoin issued by US-based operator Circle, on centralised exchanges is at its lowest level since March 2021, CCData has found.
In contrast Tether, Circle’s chief rival and by the far the largest stablecoin provider in the world, has seen the share of its eponymous token on exchanges steadily increase since the beginning of the year, recovering to pre-FTX levels. This time last year their market shares were much more evenly split.
Why the drop off in use of USDC? In March Circle had more than $3bn deposited at crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank. The uncertainty over its future briefly caused the stablecoin to lose its peg to the dollar.

Isda proposes market rules to cover crypto ‘disruptions’,Cryptocurrencies,"Disruptions unique to cryptocurrency markets will be incorporated into contracts for the global derivatives industry for the first time, in a move intended to broaden digital assets’ appeal to institutional investors.Isda, the derivatives trade association, said on Tuesday it was developing common legal standards and templates for derivatives linked to the $3tn crypto market to cover “potential disruption events”.The potential issues the London-based body singled out in a white paper included cyber attacks; forks, when a blockchain effectively splits into two branches; and airdrops, when the market is flooded with tokens, usually for free.
Isda’s master agreements are widely used as the legal template for most of the world’s derivatives trades in bonds, equities, currencies and other mainstream assets. Market participants generally follow its guidance on how to adjust contract terms if an unexpected event disrupts a derivative’s performance.
Scott O’Malia, chief executive of Isda, said the standards and definitions for digital derivatives would align with the underlying, or spot, market. “We must respect crypto assets are a unique product class and draft the definitions and legal terms accordingly,” he said.
The move comes as the crypto derivatives market soars in value and activity, and products such as bitcoin and ether futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange draw in more users. Last month, average open interest for bitcoin and ether futures hit $4.3bn and $1.2bn respectively — the first time the exchange had seen monthly open interest in ether average more than $1bn, according to data from CryptoCompare. The derivatives market now represents 55 per cent of the total crypto market, it added.As it grows, some of the biggest crypto market participants are stepping up their lobbying of regulators to try to shape the rules.
Last week Coinbase, the crypto exchange, and FTX.US, the derivatives trading market, both joined Isda, a long-established trade association whose members consist mainly of the world’s big investment banks and asset managers.
“Institutional market participants will be more willing and able to invest and trade in cryptoassets if the mechanisms to do so reflect current processes and standards,” said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure research at Coalition Greenwich.

If a cryptocurrency forks, market infrastructure providers such as trading venues, custodians and index providers may need to choose which branch of the asset to support, it said. Airdrops could have an impact on a derivatives transaction by causing an increase in the market value of the digital asset native to the benefiting network, it said.
Isda has begun a body of work to adapt its standards as traders and IT programmers explore the opportunities to trade derivatives contracts that are governed by&nbsp;computer code. Earlier this year it digitised its vast booklet of legal documents, the biggest overhaul to its rule book since 2006.
FTX has also pushed into the regulated derivatives markets by buying LedgerX, a cryptocurrency futures and options exchange and clearinghouse, for an undisclosed amount in October."
MPs call on UK ministers to regulate crypto like gambling,Cryptocurrencies,"A powerful cross-party group of MPs has called on the UK government to abandon plans to regulate crypto as a financial service and instead treat it as gambling.
The Treasury select committee said in a report that proposals for the Financial Conduct Authority to regulate the crypto industry could create “a ‘halo’ effect” that gives the impression crypto is “safer than it is” and might tempt people to put money into a speculative market they should avoid.
“The events of 2022 have highlighted the risks posed to consumers by the cryptoasset industry,” said Harriett Baldwin, the committee’s chair, referring to when UK-based crypto holders lost hundreds of millions to fraud, scandals such as FTX and wild swings in cryptocurrencies’ values.
“With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such,” she added.
A person familiar with the TSC’s position said it was taking a “very different approach” to that of the government, which has just closed a consultation on proposals for the FCA to regulate crypto in much the same way as it oversees the issue and trading of stocks and bonds.
The Gambling Commission, which has a staff of around 300, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would be willing or able to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.
“Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it’s financial services regulation — rather than gambling regulation — that has the track record in mitigating them,” said the Treasury.
“Crypto offer opportunities but we are taking an agile approach to robustly regulating the market, addressing the most pressing risks first in a way that promotes innovation,” they added.
The TSC’s is keen to avoid creating the perception that crypto is a legitimate investment, according to a person familiar with the matter, and the report did not focus on the detail of protections under both regimes,
Sam Richardson, money deputy editor at consumer advocacy group Which?, said it was “right that MPs are highlighting the risk of investors being exposed to unscrupulous firms or individuals” but he declined to comment on whether falling under the gambling regime would offer more or less protection to consumers.
Gambling firms are required to “treat customers fairly”, while the FCA has a much more detailed set of rules on trading and issuing securities and will soon impose a new consumer duty requiring firms to deliver fair outcomes.
The FCA said it welcomed “the Treasury select committee’s input to the ongoing discussion around regulating cryptoassets in the UK”, adding that it has been “working closely with the government” and is looking forward “to the outcome of its consultation and subsequent new legislation”.
The TSC’s report on crypto regulation also criticised the government for asking the Royal Mint to create a non fungible token (NFT) “as part of the chancellor of the exchequer’s ambition to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment”.
“It [the government] should seek to avoid expending public resources on supporting cryptoasset activities without a clear, beneficial use case, as appears to have been the case with the Royal Mint NFT,” the TSC said.
The FCA already has limited oversight of cryptocurrency businesses and acts as the anti-money laundering supervisor for registered entities. It will soon be able to police advertisements by crypto firms based in the UK and abroad.
The UK government’s approach to crypto regulation is largely in line with markets such as the EU and the US, where financial and securities regulators are taking on more responsibilities.
City groups had already cautioned the UK over its proposals for crypto regulation, warning the plans could offer legitimacy to a dangerous market.
The FCA warned in 2021 that consumers should be “prepared to lose all their money” if they put money into crypto products.
Later that year the FCA said Binance, by far the world’s largest crypto exchange, could not be regulated after it failed to respond to basic queries. The company has since said it intends to be regulated in the UK."
Need to Know: how will UK crypto regulation affect me?,Cryptocurrencies,"UK ministers have been put under pressure over planned crypto regulations by a group of crossbench MPs who are seeking a more radical overhaul of the industry.
The Treasury select committee published a report on Wednesday in which members said crypto should be treated like gambling, given it had “no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good”.
MPs on the committee said the government proposals would create a “halo effect”, giving consumers the impression that assets were safe and protected.
The Treasury set out in February proposals to regulate the crypto industry, including new rules to govern the issuance, trading and lending of crypto tokens — digital representations of assets — in an effort to safeguard customer funds.
Crypto exchanges would be required to comply with rules governing traditional financial services, including having to ringfence customers’ money in the event of insolvency and to undertake due diligence and monitoring of assets listed on their platform.
The government’s measures follow a period of turmoil in the sector. Several lenders and exchanges such as Celsius Network, FTX and Voyager Digital fell into difficulties over the past 12 months, sending the price of crypto down sharply and undermining investor confidence.
Expert witnesses gave evidence that crypto trading and investment activity mirrored gambling, MPs said, as they contested the government’s view that crypto activity should be regulated like any other financial service.
The committee highlighted evidence from Charles Randell, former chair of the Financial Conduct Authority, who said “speculative crypto is gambling pure and simple”. He also called for tax receipts related to crypto to be used to support debt and addiction services.
The committee also said that the government should take a stronger stance on unbacked cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether due to their price volatility and the risk that consumers will be exposed to significant losses.
Crypto UK, the industry body, hit out at the committee’s proposals, arguing they had overlooked potential benefits and use cases. It said an appropriate regulatory framework would help mitigate any risks crypto assets posed to consumers.
“Professional investment managers see bitcoin and other crypto assets as a new alternative investment class,” said Ian Taylor, Crypto UK board adviser. He said that gambling was exempt from capital gains tax, and changes would risk losing the Exchequer tens of millions of pounds.
Taylor added: “Equating cryptocurrency with gambling is both unhelpful and untrue.” Gambling companies must comply with consumer protection rules, but the FCA applies a more demanding set of regulations to trading and issuing securities.
MPs stressed that the government and regulator do not currently plan to compensate investors where they suffered significant losses. Harriett Baldwin, Conservative MP and committee chair, said: “By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens’, consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.”
However, the committee’s proposals would not remove the risk of scams, volatility or address energy consumption, according to Dion Seymour, crypto and digital assets director at the tax consultancy Andersen LLP, and former HM Revenue &amp; Customs policy lead on crypto assets.
Seymour said consumers were more concerned with being caught out by a scam. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme reported last month that more than half of all consumers expressed “fear of being scammed” while only 12 per cent said they were concerned about possible addiction.
Despite MPs expressing deep scepticism over crypto, they have said that technologies can be helpful in, for example, reducing the cost of payments. Meanwhile, the government is eager to turn the UK into a hub for the industry.
Separate to the reforms discussed in the committee’s report is the Bank of England and Treasury’s work exploring whether to issue a digital currency to protect sterling against stablecoins — types of crypto pegged against sovereign currencies — and to lower the cost of financial transactions.
Meanwhile, officials at HMRC have stepped up efforts to increase tax compliance for digital assets. From 2024-25, self-assessment tax returns will feature a standalone section for individuals and trusts which have disposed of crypto assets."
OpenAI’s Sam Altman nears $100mn funding for Worldcoin crypto project,Cryptocurrencies,"OpenAI boss Sam Altman is close to securing about $100mn in funding for his plan to use iris-scanning technology to create a secure global cryptocurrency called Worldcoin, in what would be a rare bright spot for a sector which has endured a bleak year.
According to three people with knowledge of the deal, Worldcoin is in advanced talks to raise fresh cash as it prepares to launch in the next few weeks.
The group includes existing and new investors, said one of the people. Previous investors in the company include Khosla Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund, as well as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and internet entrepreneur Reid Hoffman.
Worldcoin was founded by Altman and Alex Blania in 2019. The company has kept a low profile relative to OpenAI, the ChatGPT creator which struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft earlier this year.
But it nonetheless has grand ambitions, with plans to use eyeball-scanning technology to create a global identification system that could be used to gain free access to its own global currency, Worldcoin.
A $100mn token sale early last year valued the total supply of the company’s tokens at $3bn, according to the Information, a tech-focused publication.
But crypto tokens and projects have since had a bruising 12 months. The collapse of Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November last year accelerated the sharp decline in token prices and precipitated a wave of crypto company failures.
FTX was backed by venture capital fund Sequoia Capital, Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management and Thoma Bravo. Its implosion, and the scandal around Bankman-Fried, encouraged many blue-chip funds to curtail investment in the sector.
“It’s a bear market, a crypto winter. It’s remarkable for a project in this space to get this amount of investment,” said one of the people with direct knowledge of the fundraising.
Worldcoin executives said their approach tackles two problems raised by the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence: distinguishing between humans and bots, and providing a form of universal basic income that might offset job losses caused by AI.
Key to its plans is an orb that “uses iris biometrics to establish an individual’s unique personhood, then creates a digital World ID that can be used pseudonymously in a wide variety of everyday applications without revealing the user’s identity”, according to the company.
Once users have established their identity, they can receive free Worldcoin tokens, the company said.
Worldcoin has received criticism on a variety of issues, most notably that the biometric scanning poses privacy risks. A section of its website dedicated to addressing concerns about the orb asserts that the company will not store iris scans and that the device will not hurt users’ eyes.
Having been operating in beta, the company is now gearing up to roll out its blockchain protocol and begin recording transactions in the next six weeks.
Worldcoin declined to comment on the fundraising."
"The Bahamas, FTX and the limits of offshore crypto markets",Cryptocurrencies,"Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we’re talking about The Bahamas, once everyone’s favourite “crypto hub.”&nbsp;
If you’re a crypto business in the US, there’s a high chance this year your management team has discussed leaving for a country less hostile to what you’re trying to do.
Rightly or wrongly, American authorities have clearly decided they don’t like many of the industry’s practices. If you’re running one of these businesses, it’s quite a comedown from the days when the doors were held open and you were seen as innovative and experimental. Now you have to prove why you’re not openly flouting federal laws.
Luckily there are still some places that welcome you. Last week Coinbase received a licence in Bermuda and this week Gemini, the exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, announced it would launch a crypto derivatives market, open to users in many countries (but not China, the EU, UK, Japan and certainly not the US). Its location has yet to be revealed.
But even these friendly places may not stay quite as welcoming for long. Take The Bahamas, where FTX was based and hosted a blowout, no-expense-spared conference only a year ago (yes, really!) that now defines the peak of the crypto bubble.
It’s not a place that’s particularly welcoming to people wanting to ask about sources of wealth and regulatory standards, as I found back in November — but it’s difficult to dismiss the legacy Sam Bankman-Fried has left behind.
The FTX saga left a significant black spot on its ambition to become a hub for digital assets, so much so that regulators are rewriting their crypto laws for a fresh go around. On Tuesday the markets regulator began a consultation on rules that “strengthens financial and reporting requirements for digital asset businesses”.&nbsp;
Of particular note is a focus on “new regulatory frameworks”, including one crucial point: making sure service providers are able to return client assets and maintain procedures to ensure these assets are protected. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn’t it?
It’s something of an about-turn for The Bahamas, which was rushing to defend itself as FTX fell apart. Only six months ago Prime Minister Philip Davis said: “Based on the analysis and understanding of the FTX liquidity crisis to date, we have not identified any deficiencies in our regulatory framework that could have avoided this.”&nbsp;
I asked the PM’s office this week why new legislation was necessary, given such a strong defence of his country’s laws. I didn’t receive a response.
In fact the island had already started to look again at its rules. The Securities Commission of The Bahamas said it began reviewing its legislation in April 2022, months before FTX’s collapse. It has also engaged law firm Hogan Lovells — which is also lobbying for Binance US’s interests in Washington DC — to begin drafting new laws, although it didn’t say when the work began. The SCB did not respond to a request for comment.
A person familiar with Bahamian regulations told me via email that “as the digital assets space evolved and new risks became apparent, particularly following the crypto winter of 2022, it became necessary to update the legislative framework”, adding it “is not unusual for regulation to be reactive to emerging threats”.&nbsp;
That’s true; but it’s also a reminder that if the choice is between welcoming crypto companies and toughening your standards to save face internationally, there comes a point when even the most “progressive” regulators raises the barrier.
What’s your take on The Bahamas’ fresh approach to crypto rules? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.&nbsp;Join me and FT colleagues at the FT’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on May 9-10 as we discuss where the digital assets market is heading. Also appearing at the event will be the UK’s economic secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith and Hester Peirce of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Register for your pass here.
From one “crypto hub” to another: I wrote about my home Gibraltar being forced into the spotlight by the failure of Globix, a cryptocurrency trader incorporated in the British Virgin Islands but whose investors were mostly from the British Overseas Territory. I revealed that liquidators are searching for $43mn in missing funds, and at least one sitting member of Gibraltar’s parliament was an investor. Read my scoop here.
On Thursday the UK said it would review the way it collected taxes on trades in decentralised finance, which usually involves lending and staking of crypto assets. The consultation follows a sweeping new regulatory regime proposed by the UK earlier this year and is another sign of the government’s will to turn the UK into a crypto hub.
Binance US — the American arm of offshore giant Binance — abandoned its proposed $1bn acquisition of assets belonging to Voyager Digital, a crypto lender that went bankrupt last year. The exchange tried for months to convince regulators to give the deal the green light, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which was reviewing the deal for potential security risks. In the end, Binance US gave up, blaming . . . you guessed it, a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States”.&nbsp;
A small windfall for FTX: the bankrupt exchange has agreed to sell its futures and clearing business LedgerX LLC to stock and derivatives exchange MIAX for $50mn. One takeaway from this: LedgerX was fully US regulated, with a licence from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, making it more viable than other parts of the former Bankman-Fried empire. John Ray III, who took over as FTX chief, said the deal was an “example of our continuing efforts to monetise assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders”.&nbsp;
A Jack Dorsey-backed non-profit called the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF) is co-ordinating the defence of bitcoin developers targeted in lawsuits by Craig Wright, who has claimed — without proof — to be the identity behind bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. You can read all about the case via the BLDF website here.
This year Coinbase received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission, America’s chief financial markets watchdog. These notices are uncomfortable because they inform a company that an enforcement action is probably coming its way.
Correspondence is also usually kept private but Coinbase has opted to fight it out in public. This week it published its response, laying out why it thought the regulator is wrong. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal sums it up as:
“Coinbase is the same company that we were when the SEC allowed us to become public two years ago . . . we didn’t list securities then, and we still don’t. We’d like to in the future, but the SEC has still not complied with the law by providing companies like Coinbase with a way to register to be able to do that.”&nbsp;
Global regulators have long worried that stablecoins could grow to a size where they pose a considerable risk to financial stability. That makes perfect sense of course; but right now the stablecoin market is going in the other direction.
According to numbers provided by data analytics platform CCData, the total circulating value of stablecoins has been declining for more than a year. In April, the total stablecoin market cap fell more than 1 per cent to $131bn, its lowest point since September 2021.
And while the market shrinks, Tether continues to tighten its grip. There are currently more than $80bn tethers in circulation, up from $66bn at the start of the year.
In contrast Circle’s USDC, long considered Tether’s chief rival, has done nothing but shrink (and briefly de-peg during a time of crisis). At the time of writing there are just $30bn USDC tokens in circulation, a far cry from the $55bn flowing through the market last summer.

The FT crypto glossary,Cryptocurrencies,"Alt or alternative coins: Any cryptocurrency other than the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is known as an alt-coin. Alt-coins range from relatively well-established and popular coins like Ether through to joke currencies like dogecoin. The term is also sometimes applied to stablecoins or to tokens that represent a stake of ownership, such as a security token.
Automated Market Maker: An actor that encourages buyers and sellers in a decentralised market. Like market makers on traditional markets, they aim to make money from discrepancies in pricing on different markets, until the asset price falls into line across all markets. An automated market maker deposits their own pair of cryptocurrencies into a smart contract and lets computer code handle buying and selling with interested parties, who are also using their own smart contracts. Owners of assets are incentivised by sharing in the pool of fees that are generated through trading activity. The process has been compared to YouTube because investors can generate and upload their own content.
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision: The world’s most powerful standards setter for banks. It determines how banks control risks and how much equity they should hold to protect themselves if markets or customers blow up. It has proposed differing digital asset categories for banks wanting to buy and sell crypto for customers or themselves. Banks can treat stock tokens and stablecoins on their balance sheets like existing assets, with some rule modifications. Bitcoin and others would come under a new “conservative” prudential regime, so banks would need to hold at least enough equity to more than cover all potential losses.
Binance: By some measures, the world’s largest unregulated cryptocurrency exchange. Founded by Changpeng Zhao in 2016, it claims not to have a headquarters but has semi-autonomous units operating around the world. Regulators, globally, are scrutinising the company and some have already barred it from their jurisdictions. However, users have still been able to access its website.
Bitcoin: The biggest and original cryptocurrency that launched an entire industry. It was envisaged by its pseudonymous creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”.
BNB coin: The cryptocurrency of the exchange Binance. It was launched in 2017 with the promise that only 200mn tokens will ever exist. Every quarter, Binance uses a fifth of its profits to destroy already existing coins, in a bid to make them more scarce and in turn, more valuable. The coins can be used to pay for Binance services, to pay trading fees, or for trading — just like Bitcoin and others.
Blockchain: A type of distributed ledger, written on open source software. It is a growing database of time-stamped transactions that cannot be altered. Each new transaction is verified by a network of computers and added as a “block” to the chain.
Burning coins: Inflation is one of the enemies of cryptocurrencies. Thus, there is a counterpart to minting new coins: burning them, thereby removing them from circulation. For stablecoins, burning is particularly important to keep the token supply equal to the asset backing they have.
Cardano: A blockchain network that can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its own digital currency, Ada. The name honours English mathematician and writer Ada Lovelace, who is viewed as the world’s first software engineer because she created an algorithm in the 19th century. It promises to use less energy than Bitcoin or ethereum because it uses proof-of-stake protocols to verify transactions. It was developed by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of ethereum, who left after a dispute with other fellow co-founders, including Vitalik Buterin. Cardano’s Ada is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, with more people holding it on trading platform eToro than Bitcoin.
Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs): Proposed digital currencies run by central banks, rather than created by private companies. They would use the same technology but would be backed by reserves. Central bankers have been spurred on by fears that efforts such as Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency could impact monetary policy, and destabilise financial markets or cross-border money transfers.
Coin: A cryptocurrency that lives on its own independent blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin and ether. Distinct from a token.
Coinbase: The largest US listed exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens. Customers can also deposit their crypto assets with the exchange and lend them out, earning interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates.
Cold storage: Storing crypto assets on a computer in a vault, which is not connected to the internet. Many cold storage wallets do not accept as many kinds of cryptocurrencies and are more expensive storage options. Consequently, many traders prefer to use a hot wallet.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)The main US regulator for derivatives. The agency has determined that, in legal terms, virtual currencies like Bitcoin are commodities. That means it has jurisdiction to oversee derivatives that use a digital currency and potentially hand out penalties if there is fraud or manipulation of those derivatives.
Cryptocurrency: A currency created digitally, usually by private companies, and named after the cryptographic maths that make it possible. It was conceived in the depths of the financial crisis by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way for people to make electronic payments without going through any financial institutions.
Crypto exchange: A venue for buying and selling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and ether. They often also offer loans and custody of assets, and other services that a traditional exchange cannot. Examples of crypto exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Bybit, Kraken, Gemini, Bitfinex and Bitstamp.
DApp: A computer application that runs on a decentralised finance network, such as a distributed ledger.
DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation): An organisation whose rules are automated or developed by consensus among the members. It is designed to work unlike a typical corporate structure, where power lies in the hands of an executive or board.
Decentralised finance (DeFi): An umbrella term for a collection of cryptoasset projects that aim to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services. They use DApps to execute common services like lending, savings accounts and trading coins.
Decentralised trading protocol: Sometimes referred to as a decentralised exchange, or DEX. It is a network that allows users to buy and sell digital assets directly with each other, bypassing intermediaries that might impose fees, such as an exchange or clearing house. Automated market makers use smart contracts which can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Older trading networks, such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, are written on ethereum but newer networks like Pyth may use alternative protocols like Solana or Polkadot. However, some networks may suffer from low liquidity. There is also little recourse for users who find their security hacked and assets stolen.
Diem: The yet-to-be launched digital coin by Facebook and previously known as Libra. It has been credited with jolting central banks and regulators into realising that private cryptocurrency initiatives were becoming too big to ignore, and to start on their own CBDCs. The intense scrutiny led Facebook to change the name from Libra and scale back its ambitions in 2020.
Digital Currency Group: Venture capital firm that has funded dozens of projects, such as investment firm Grayscale, exchange Coinbase and broker eToro.
Distributed ledger: A public register of deals shared and replicated by a network of computers. They work together to verify transactions and create an immutable ledger, and do away with the need for a central authority. It is similar to a blockchain but it does not need to have its data structured in blocks. Nor does it need to use proof of work to mine tokens.
dogecoin: An alt-coin that purposely began as a joke, to highlight the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies in 2013. It uses a Japanese Shiba Inu dog as its mascot and has surged in popularity and value despite its beginnings.
Ether: The world’s second most actively-traded cryptocurrency and the token associated with ethereum.
Ethereum: A developer-run blockchain technology co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian computer science student. Its aim is to make blockchains more useful and revolutionary than simply to serve as a database for transactions. Its technology can hold assets, enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts, and is typically also the building block for most DApps for finance.
Fiat currency: A traditional currency backed and regulated by a central bank — such as the US dollar, euro, sterling and yen.
Flippening: A term the moment when ether overtakes Bitcoin as the biggest and most valuable cryptocurrency.
Fork: Developers sometimes disagree on how a blockchain should be run and, if they cannot settle their differences, the ultimate step is to create a fork in the network. One side will use newer software and the existing network will rely on the older version. It means that two incompatible versions of the blockchain emerge, based on different principles and with different user bases. Forks can take place for a number of reasons including concerns over outdated and insecure software, or a need to reverse the log of transactions following a hack, or a need to return investors’ funds to them.
FTX: A fast-growing Hong Kong based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange founded in 2019 by former trader Sam Bankman-Fried.
FUD: An acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt”, used as a dismissive label for negative information about cryptocurrencies — and normally to imply that criticisms of digital assets are invalid or misleading. The Fud label is often applied to critiques focusing on Bitcoin’s environmental impact or the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering. People who spread Fud are called Fudsters.
Gas Fees: The fees paid by users to compensate for the amount of computing energy needed to verify a transaction on the ethereum network. They are intended to prevent nefarious actors from spamming the network. Prices can rise and fall depending on demand. Users have complained about ethereum’s fees, which can cost anything from $20 — $100, because ethereum is so heavily used.
Gemini: An exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens set up in 2014 by the Winklevoss twins. Customers can also deposit assets and earn interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates.
Governance tokens: Tokens that give holders voting powers on a blockchain protocol. They are mainly used in DeFi projects so systems can remain decentralised and no one party makes the decisions on the project’s future direction.
Greyscale Investment Trust: A fund that operates the world’s most popular Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
Have fun staying poor: The ultimate retort from crypto enthusiasts to sceptics — expressing their pity for non-believers. It is usually used to counter criticism of Bitcoin or other digital assets and it implies that sceptics do not understand the full implications of blockchain technology.
Hodl: The battle cry of the long-term cryptocurrency holder. Originally a humorous misspelling of ‘hold’ found on a cryptocurrency forum in 2013 and sometimes thought to be an acronym for “Holding On For Dear Life”, the frantic tone associated with its use has struck a chord with the wider crypto community. Hodling is not simply about keeping crypto-investments no matter how low they fall. It also reflects an almost religious belief in the inevitability of a return to profitability and a rejection of both the fickle, unmanly day trader and the myopic, untrustworthy crypto-sceptic.
Hot wallet: A virtual wallet to store crypto assets. It is kept online which means it is easier to access and enables users to trade more quickly. But being online makes it more susceptible to being hacked, so some people prefer to keep their assets in cold storage.
ICO: Like an initial public offering, an initial coin offering is a tool for fundraising. But the similarities end there. Investors get some of the new currency, as opposed to stock in the company. And, unlike IPOs, ICOs lack any investor protection: they can be set up with just a website, a utopian mission statement and some ad spend. After a surge in popularity in 2017-18, ICOs came under sustained scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK and Europe over the dangers they posed to consumers. In 2019, messaging apps Kik and Telegram were both sued over their ICOs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Laser eyes: A social media meme in which users change or edit their profile pictures to make their eyes look like they emit red laser beams. It denotes a fan of cryptocurrencies, with the light-emitting powers variously interpreted to mean a user has special powers of sight and an iron will to make Bitcoin an instrument of economic empowerment.
Layer 2: A secondary network or technology run by a third party and built on top of an existing blockchain to improve its efficiency. For example, some blockchains like Bitcoin and ethereum cannot handle vast quantities of trades at high speed, affecting the users of some DApps. A layer 2 network can handle the bulk of the transaction processing legwork, so the original blockchain can scale.
Liquidity pool: A central feature of decentralised trading. Customers do not trade on an order book but against other participants in the pool, who have also filled up the pool with funds that sit on smart contracts.
Memecoin: A cryptocurrency that is associated with a meme or viral online joke. dogecoin is a popular example of a memecoin.
Metaverse: A vision of the future internet. An immersive virtual reality world where people will be able to pursue all aspects of life as if in a parallel digital universe.
Mining: The act of employing a large network of computers to work together to solve cryptographic calculations that verify cryptocurrency transactions. Typically, one party will solve the puzzle, known as a hash, that creates the next block in the chain. The others will verify it. In return for maintaining the blockchain, miners are rewarded with new tokens for being the first to solve the cryptographic proof. They also collect transaction fees.
Mooning, aka Going to the Moon: When the price and trading volume of a cryptocurrency are both soaring.
Musk, Elon: One of the world’s most influential cryptocurrency advocates, with the power to raise or drop prices of coins with a single tweet or Saturday evening TV appearance. Sometimes sells electric cars, too.
Nakamoto, Satoshi: The pseudonymous creator — or creators — of Bitcoin. The seminal moment was the publication of a whitepaper in 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed amid the global financial crisis.
NFT: A non-fungible token. A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights.
NGMI: “Not Going To Make It” — slang for missing out on the profits of a trade. Its opposite is “GMI”, or Going to Make It.
Nocoiner: A sceptic who doesn’t own any cryptocurrency, believes it has little to no value and suspects it might be a Ponzi scheme that will fail.
Node: Its definition varies, but is usually understood to mean a physical point on a computer network where an activity takes place. Sometimes, it can be to collect and distribute information; sometimes, it is where transactions on a blockchain are verified.
OpenSea: The world’s largest peer-to-peer marketplace for trading NFTs.
Oracle: A third party that acts as a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world. It gathers data from the outside world, such as asset prices, and sends it to a blockchain or distributed ledger. That data can be used in smart contracts for other crypto trading projects. It can also work in reverse, using information in smart contracts in the outside world.
PancakeSwap: A decentralised trading protocol based on the Binance blockchain. Customers can exchange Binance tokens. It uses automated market makers to trade assets.
Private key: The complex password needed to access a virtual currency wallet.
Proof-of-stake: A system for mining cryptocurrencies that requires users to stake their coins as collateral to become a verifier on the network. It is largely associated with the ethereum blockchain. Unlike proof-of-work systems, verifiers are chosen at random to create blocks and validate proposed blocks. If they attest to fraudulent blocks, they will lose their staked coins. As no coins are mined, the process should not require vast amounts of computing energy. However, it has been hard to scale and ethereum’s blockchain has struggled to keep up with demand. Critics have argued the system favours richer participants because the more coins a miner owns, the more mining power it has.
Proof-of-work Used in mining, it allows one party to prove it has solved the cryptographic puzzle to validate a transaction, while the others verify the work. Its aim is to prevent the same coins being spent twice with two different parties. Largely associated with the Bitcoin blockchain, it has been criticised for its high energy consumption and slow speed. Developers are looking at proof-of-stake mining as a cheaper, faster and less environmentally-damaging alternative.
Pyth: A DeFi project and Oracle, built by some of the world’s largest high-speed traders as a “potential game changer” for trading stocks and other assets on blockchain technology.
Rekt In the world of gaming, you might shout rekt when you gun down an opponent in Fortnite, the violent and popular video game. In cryptocurrencies, someone is rekt if they suffer a loss as a result of a bad crypto investment. A cryptocurrency that has gone down significantly in value could also be said to be rekt.
Rugpull A common method of defrauding investors in the wild west world of DeFi, where anyone can list a coin and compete for investors’ money. Scammers set-up a new coin that promises to be the next big moneymaking opportunity. After attracting investors, usually via chat rooms or other social media channels, and convincing enough of them to put money into the projects, the developers of the coin then vanish into thin (decentralised) air.
Security token: Similar to the securities that are traded on a stock or bond market but ownership is recorded on a blockchain rather than in a central depository. The tokens often promise a share in future profits or repayments. Regulators around the world usually regard them as in their regulatory jurisdiction.
Securities and Exchange Commission: The US securities regulator. Its jurisdiction over crypto markets is limited but does regulate digital assets securities. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has called on legislators to give it the power to regulate crypto exchanges.
Sharding: Splitting a network into separate but linked ledgers, so it can reduce the strain on each node in the network by no longer requiring it to validate every transaction.
Saylor, Michael: Chief executive of MicroStrategy, a software company that has taken the unusual step of buying thousands of Bitcoins. In 2020, he tweeted that Bitcoin was “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.”
Silbert, Barry: Entrepreneur, early investor in the crypto industry, and founder of Digital Currency Group. A Bitcoin whale.
Smart contract: A computer program that can contain financial assets and be coded with the ability to execute actions by itself, if certain conditions are met. That could include transferring funds or sending notifications. Smart contracts play a crucial role in decentralised trading protocols.
Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, usually the world’s biggest and most stable currencies. They act as crypto-native dollars and a bridge between crypto and traditional financial worlds. They also allow traders to more easily convert traditional currencies into cryptocurrencies for trading. The coins can be lent as collateral for trading, or to generate high yields in the form of interest. They are supposed to have a fixed price and be backed by reserves at all times, allowing users to redeem them. However, critics have questioned where some stablecoins keep their reserves and whether the assets can be quickly recovered and redeemed. The two biggest stablecoin operators are Tether and USDC, run by Circle. A few stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies or baskets of other cryptocurrencies. They use algorithms to buy and sell in order to keep themselves fully backed. But these algorithmic stablecoins can collapse if anything happens to the cryptocurrencies to which they are pegged. They remain a small part of the market.
Solana: A blockchain protocol that can handle smart contracts and claims faster speeds and lower transaction costs than ethereum.
Staking: A protocol that aims to boost asset owners’ earnings. Users lock their crypto in their wallet but give permission for a third party, often an exchange, to stake their crypto on DeFi projects that offer interest or yield farming. The barriers to staking are quite high and users normally need to hold a lot of a particular cryptocurrency first. Binance and Coinbase both offer staking.
Tether: The largest and most controversial stablecoin, with over 60bn tokens in circulation. It is nominally pegged to the US dollar and says all its tokens are backed by dollars, one-for-one. It plays an important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, because its tokens are used by investors who want to leverage their returns on more volatile cryptocurrencies. However, the New York attorney-general ruled it had deceived clients over its reserves after it suffered a serious loss of funds when its payment processors’ accounts were frozen. Tether did not admit to any wrongdoing, but paid a settlement of $18.5m. Its self-declared commercial paper (a form of debt security) holdings would make it one of the world’s largest investors in the market, according to JPMorgan.
Token: A unit built on an existing blockchain and intended to be an incentive or reward for developing other projects on that blockchain. The best known example is ERC20, a token on the ethereum blockchain, which has built other digital assets and currencies. Distinct from a coin.
Trustless: A central tenet of the crypto industry. Computing systems like blockchain eliminate the need for a trusted third party, like a bank or clearing house, to check or execute transactions.
Uniswap: A decentralised trading protocol built on the ethereum blockchain. It is also the name of the company set up by Hayden Adams, the developer behind Uniswap.
Whale: Much like their marine counterparts, cryptocurrency whales are reclusive creatures whose activity has an effect on the whole ecosystem. They are individuals or institutions that hold a large proportion of the coins of a particular cryptocurrency. A rule of thumb is that a whale owns more than 5 per cent of a given coin. That makes them key actors in the price of the asset. Holding the asset can keep it out of circulation, boosting its price. Selling can cause the price to dip, especially if the volume floods the market. In an unregulated market, it invites accusations they are manipulating the market. Few whales are known because identities are anonymous, but they can be recognised by the internet addresses controlled by a single network participant. Known bitcoin whales include the Winklevoss twins.
Whitepaper: Part marketing tool, part technical documentation and part vision statement, a whitepaper sets out how a cryptocurrency works, what it is trying to do and the creator’s projections for profitability. Whitepapers have often been associated with the ICO craze. However, whitepapers are produced by almost all cryptocurrency companies as standard procedure. The most famous was written by Satoshi Nakamoto.
Winklevoss, Cameron and Tyler: Twin brothers who were early and vocal backers of Bitcoin when it was still a hobby for enthusiasts in the early 2010s. Regarded as Bitcoin whales because they bought large holdings when the currency was worth only cents. They rose to pre-crypto fame because of their claims that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them.
Wrapped token: A cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another token. They have identical values but enable one token to lives on a Blockchain that it was not issued on. For example, Bitcoin and ethereum blockchains cannot talk to each other; but a wrapped token acts as a bridge between the two.
Yield farming: The practice of looking through the DeFi world for best yields available from more obscure projects and coins. These opportunities can advertise interest rates as high as several thousand per cent to pull in digital cash but can also be short lived.

US court provides clarity on crypto rules with OpenSea verdict,Cryptocurrencies,"Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we’re taking a look at the world’s first NFT insider trading case.
“We need regulatory clarity” is fast becoming the rallying cry for crypto companies frustrated with the US crackdown on digital assets.
In fairness to the complaints, the US oversees the industry through a patchwork of existing federal securities, banking and derivatives laws. Congress does not yet have a legislative package on the same level as the EU’s recently passed Mica regulation. No one regulator has full remit over the space at the federal level — not even Gary Gensler, the hard-charging chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But this week the US courts spoke loud and clear on the application of existing rules in one area, inside information and NFTs. They’re the non-fungible tokens that are bought and sold on the blockchain that briefly enlivened the art world last year.
Nate Chastain, former product manager at OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, was on Wednesday found guilty of fraud and money laundering after purchasing NFTs that, owing to his position, he expected would become popular once displayed on OpenSea’s website. Chastain, who will be sentenced at a later date, is facing a maximum of 40 years in prison.
Prosecutors alleged that Chastain bought 45 tokens over roughly a five-month period before they appeared on OpenSea, only to sell them soon after display for between two and five times the price he paid.
Assistant US attorney Allison Nichols referred to messages from Chastain that showed he had a “fear of missing out”. “He saw a way to make some extra money, to capture some upside,” she said in closing arguments this week.
Chastain’s defence argued that he had no training or guidance at OpenSea that would have taught him to avoid buying the NFTs in question, adding that the marketplace had “no policies” in place before he bought his tokens.
But a chunk of his defence also rested on one of the crypto market’s biggest gripes: insider trading charges apply to securities or commodities, and that NFTs (like a lot of other crypto tokens) have not been legally designated as either.
Notably though, the court verdict sidestepped this thorny issue.
“If it looks like a duck . . . in the case of Mr Chastain, the facts as laid out by the government had classic markings of insider trading and why it’s prohibited to begin with,” BakerHostetler litigation partner Joanna Wasick told me this week.
“A white-collar, presumably well-resourced individual is in the privileged position to access key non-public information. The person takes that information and does with it what the Average Joe cannot — exploits the confidential data to make even more money,” she added.
This clearly has implications for the rest of the crypto market; insider trading is insider trading, regardless of whether it involves securities, commodities, or digital pictures of apes lacking enthusiasm for life.
In fact, the case serves as the perfect microcosm of the wide disconnect between the crypto industry and American lawmakers. People such as Coinbase’s chief executive Brian Armstrong argue that the US “needs to update its finance system”.
Perhaps, but no matter when the laws emerge and in what form they take, they’re unlikely to undercut existing federal laws.
“Nothing in the government’s case turns on classifying the NFTs at issue as securities, or any other regulated instrument,” Peter Fox, partner at law firm Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti &amp; Fox, told me over email.
What are your thoughts on Chastain’s case? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.
Join me and FT colleagues at the FT’s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on May 9-10 as we discuss where the digital assets market is heading. Also appearing at the event are the UK’s economic secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith and Hester Peirce of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Register for your pass here.
Coinbase has reported a narrower loss than expected in its first-quarter results. The Nasdaq-listed exchange reported a loss of 34 cents a share on more than $772mn in revenues, above the estimated $653mn. Shares in the company rose 7 per cent in after-hours trading yesterday.
The White House released a report proposing that firms engaged in crypto mining practices face a 30 per cent tax for the cost of the electricity they use. The policy would mark yet another recognition of the immense energy costs involved in mining cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. According to Cambridge university, bitcoin’s electricity consumption levels are at present roughly equivalent to the entire nation of Ukraine.
Another word on bitcoin: while the flagship cryptocurrency has enjoyed its longest winning streak for more than two years, there are plenty of signs investors are still reluctant to buy into crypto. Read my piece on how crypto’s recent rally has been built on an increasingly thinly traded market.
One year on from the infamous collapse of Terraform Labs, South Korea is tightening its grip on digital asset trading. At the heart of the country’s crypto reckoning is wemix — a token issued by a local game developer that quickly surged in popularity among gamers flocking to “play-to-earn” video games.
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority continues its hawk-eyed clampdown on illegally operated crypto ATMs. In a joint operation with law enforcement agencies the regulator “inspected” sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield. They had previously gone after sites in east London and West Yorkshire. Big league stuff.
Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong has been vague on whether the exchange would consider leaving the US should regulatory pressure — which he perceives as unjustified — continues.
“Anything is on the table,” he said during a visit to London last month.
On an analysts’ call following last night’s results, the Coinbase chief was much more straightforward.
“So let me be clear, we’re 100% committed to the US. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here. That’s really important, and I’m actually really optimistic on the US getting this right.”
Crypto prices rallied, and then crypto prices fell flat. But despite the market’s many challenges (again, read my latest here) at least investors feel slightly less poor now.
Assets under management for digital asset investment products, offered by companies such as Grayscale, rose to $33.5bn by the end of last month, data from provider CCData has found. That’s the fifth consecutive month of growth and a 70 per cent return year to date. Still not as high as last summer’s, but it’s a start.

US crypto clampdown pushes exchanges to go offshore,Cryptocurrencies,"US cryptocurrency exchanges are setting up offshore venues in a hunt for overseas customers and to escape being ensnared in a regulatory blitz from US authorities.
Two of the largest venues, Nasdaq-listed Coinbase and Gemini, have stepped up plans to launch marketplaces outside the US following enforcement cases against domestic crypto companies.
US regulators have toughened oversight of the digital assets market following the failure of lenders such as Celsius Network and FTX, the exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried. Besides targeting individuals, watchdogs have also deemed some products illegal in the US and forced companies to pull lucrative business.
By contrast US crypto exchanges’ offshore rivals have been able to launch products and take market share with less fear of reprisal. Binance, which says it has no headquarters, has become the world’s largest crypto exchange with daily volumes that dwarf US rivals.
“For crypto companies trying to engage in compliance, they get punished in the marketplace by competitors that believe it’s better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission,” said John Reed Stark, former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s internet enforcement division.
Coinbase said securing a licence in Bermuda would increase “economic freedom and opportunity” for its customers. But the US crackdown has also heightened investors’ nerves about using the US market.
Since the start of the year Kraken agreed to end its staking business in the US, in which customers agree to lock up their tokens in other crypto projects in return for a high yield, as part of a settlement with the SEC.
Paxos shut down further issuance of BUSD, the Binance-branded stablecoin, a token used to help traders move more quickly in and out of the crypto market; the SEC warned Coinbase it may face an enforcement action; and Bakkt quickly delisted 25 of the 36 available tokens on purchase of Apex Crypto, citing “regulatory guidance”.

As uncertainty lingers, US marketplaces are losing ground to offshore rivals. Since January Coinbase’s share of the spot crypto market has almost halved to 5 per cent, according to data from Kaiko. Binance gained 30 per cent, partly on the back of free trading.
Smaller rivals such as Turkish crypto platform BtcTurk, Korea’s UpBit and EU-based Bitpanda have recorded double-digit gains in cumulative trade volume in the first four months of 2023, compared to the previous four-month period. Coinbase and Gemini have declined in the same period, Kaiko also found.
Without common global standards, exchanges are looking around the world for a favourable regime as a base for their growth plans. From offshore locations Coinbase and Gemini will both launch perpetual futures, a type of derivative widely favoured by regular traders, and a source of income for companies such as Binance.
“Regulation and standards for this market have been rolled out differently in different markets, in some cases there’s bespoke regimes, in some cases there’s no regime . . . it’s all very much a moving target at this moment in time,” Eva Gustavsson, head of public affairs at digital assets company Copper.co, told an FT conference last week.
The type of money most commonly used in crypto markets has also flowed out of the US in recent months. Most daily trading is done through buying and selling popular tokens such as bitcoin with stablecoins like tether. Stablecoins are normally pegged to the world’s biggest currencies and act as a bridge between crypto and traditional markets.
Since January the market share of British Virgin Islands-registered Tether has risen by a fifth to $82bn, representing more than 60 per cent of the market.
In contrast Circle, a stablecoin issuer that holds an array of US money transmitter licenses, has lost a third of its market share in the same period. Only $30bn of Circle’s USDC coins are now in circulation.
Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, argued solid US rules for governing crypto would reverse the flow, as investors would be attracted by predictable rules.
“When you have . . . central companies that are dealing with customers, it’s very likely you’re going to want to have some regulatory regime around them because you find out that centralised companies do the same kind of dastardly things whether or not they’re in crypto or something else.”
But many crypto executives acknowledge there are limits to escaping US rules.
“Crypto firms considering offshore locations like Bermuda in response to intensifying regulation may view this as an appealing short-term solution . . . if you want to serve the US market, then you need to work with US regulators,” said Thomas Hook, chief compliance officer at Bitstamp, a European exchange.
Moreover the criminal charges brought against some of FTX’s senior management, and civil charges against Binance for illegally serving US customers, underscore how US authorities have long extended their reach across borders, when it affects consumers or the dollar.
“US law is very clear on this: you can be a foreign entity but as soon as you touch American customers you have established jurisdiction for US regulatory agencies, period,” said Charley Cooper, former chief of staff at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

US crypto tsar promises crackdown on digital platforms,Cryptocurrencies,"The top US cryptocurrency enforcement tsar is promising a crackdown on illicit behaviour on digital platforms, saying the scale of crypto crime has grown “significantly” in the past four years.
The Department of Justice is targeting crypto exchanges along with the “mixers and tumblers” that obscure the trail of transactions, Eun Young Choi, who was appointed director of the agency’s national cryptocurrency enforcement team last year, told the Financial Times in an interview. The DoJ is targeting companies that commit crimes themselves or allow them to happen, such as enabling money laundering, she said.
“But on top of that, they’re allowing for all the other criminal actors to easily profit from their crimes and cash out in ways that are obviously problematic to us,” she added. “And so we hope that by focusing on those types of platforms, we’re going to have a multiplier effect.”
Choi said the focus on platforms would “send a deterrent message” to businesses that are skirting anti-money laundering or client identification rules, and who were not investing in solid compliance and risk mitigation procedures.
Choi heads a new unit focused on criminal misuse of digital assets as the US under the administration of President Joe Biden has emerged as one of the jurisdictions with the toughest stance on crypto worldwide.
“We’re seeing the scale and the scope of digital assets being used in a variety of illicit ways grow significantly over the last, say, four years,” she said.
“I think that is concurrent with the increase of its adoption by the public writ large.”
Choi’s comments come after the crypto industry was shaken last year by the collapse of FTX, the exchange that had been widely perceived as a sound player in an often-volatile sector. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces criminal charges including wire fraud as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering and violate campaign finance laws. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Washington has also targeted Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. The US derivatives watchdog in March sued the company and its chief executive Changpeng Zhao for operating illegally in the country. The exchange has said it has no formal headquarters and does not serve US customers.
There are concerns in the industry that a greater crackdown on companies of systemic importance such as Binance would throw the broader industry into further disarray.
But Choi, without referring to any specific entity, said a company’s size “is not something that the department will countenance” while weighing potential charges.
If a company “has amassed a significant market share in part because they’re [flouting] US criminal law”, the DoJ cannot “be in a position where we give someone a pass because they’re saying ‘Well, now we’ve grown to be too big to fail’“, Choi said.
“Think of what message it would send,” she added. “It can’t be the way that we think when it comes to crypto, when it comes to any white-collar crime.”
Bitzlato, a digital exchange that US authorities have described as a key link to the dark net, was taken down in January when the DoJ arrested its founder for allegedly transmitting more than $700mn in illicit crypto funds.
Beyond platforms, the DoJ’s crypto unit aims to bring more enforcement actions targeting investment scams, as the volume of funds lost to such schemes has ballooned from approximately $900mn in 2021 to more than $2.5bn last year, according to victims’ reports to the FBI.
Choi highlighted “pig butchering” schemes, which are named after a Chinese phrase referencing fattening pigs for slaughter, and involve scammers building relationships with victims over the long term.
The justice department last month seized crypto worth more than $112mn linked to such scams.
The DoJ is also focusing on thefts and hacks involving decentralised finance (DeFi), Choi said, particularly “chain bridges”, where users can exchange different types of digital tokens, or nascent projects with codes that are vulnerable to these attacks.
The justice department in February charged a man for defrauding DeFi platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110mn.
This is a “pretty significant issue” for the DoJ given North Korean state-sponsored hackers have emerged as key actors in this space, Choi said."
"US risks falling behind Europe without crypto rules, warns SEC commissioner",Cryptocurrencies,"The US risks falling behind the EU and UK without rules for governing crypto asset markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce has warned.
Speaking at the Financial Times’ crypto and digital assets summit, the US stock market regulator’s senior Republican member said frameworks set out by Brussels and London could be a blueprint for Washington lawmakers.
The EU has drawn up an extensive set of new rules, known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (Mica) regulation, which is expected to come into force next year.
The UK earlier this year set out a sweeping new regulatory regime for crypto that aims to bring the rules governing crypto tokens in line with those already in place for traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.
“[The UK’s] approach is one that can serve as a model for us, Mica can serve as a model for us,” Peirce said. “I think we’re shooting ourselves in the foot by not having a regulatory regime in the US.”
Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights
In contrast to the UK and EU, the US has not developed a regime for regulating crypto assets, instead opting to issue a wave of enforcement cases against crypto activity, predominantly led by SEC chair Gary Gensler. Some of the biggest crypto firms, including lender Genesis, and exchanges Gemini and Kraken, have been targeted by the US securities regulator.
Peirce, one of five members of the SEC, has often split with Gensler over cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler has resisted crafting new rules for crypto markets, arguing that existing laws are sufficiently clear.
The SEC has also issued a Wells notice to publicly listed exchange Coinbase, warning that it was considering potential enforcement action against the crypto exchange over possible securities laws violations.
America’s crackdown on digital assets has raised questions over whether the industry will leave the US and set up in offshore jurisdictions with rules perceived as friendly to crypto business.
“You keep coming back to this question of what if people move their companies to [other jurisdictions]. The point is if we built a good regulatory regime, people would come,” Peirce said.
Speaking at the same panel, senior officials from the US Treasury and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority said it was important for regulators to extend their oversight beyond national boundaries in order to adequately mitigate risks posed by the crypto industry.
Sandra Lee, deputy assistant secretary for the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the US Treasury, emphasised the “importance of supervisors and regulators to be able to see into affiliates and subsidiaries of certain crypto asset firms”.
Sarah Pritchard, executive director of supervision, policy and competition at the FCA, said the UK’s proposed crypto rules “will bite on firms marketing to UK consumers”, adding that the regulator “will be on the lookout for firms that are not abiding by those rules”.
The FCA has previously warned consumers to be prepared to lose all their money if they invested in crypto assets."
‘Mr White Hat:’ The story behind a $600m crypto caper,Cryptocurrencies,"An hour after the world discovered an alleged hacker had made off with $600m in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency heists, the thief tipped a bystander $42,000 for warning that some of the assets were being frozen.
The apparent act of generosity was only the first unexpected twist in a virtual robbery that has gripped the crypto industry and left many observers scratching their heads.
The mystery hacker’s target was an obscure group called Poly Network, a project in the world of decentralised finance, known as DeFi, which links together some of the most widely-used digital ledgers. DeFi is the cutting edge of the digital asset world. Developers are building automated networks to allow individuals and companies to skip fee-charging intermediaries like banks and exchanges.&nbsp;
In the crypto market, all transactions can be seen on digital ledgers. Poly took advantage of this feature in the same way a bank can alert authorities to the serial numbers on stolen cash. It called on other industry participants to “blacklist” the stolen loot, making it much more difficult for the hacker to move it without getting caught.
With escape routes rapidly closing down to move such a large sum, the hacker began making the case that they were an altruistic thief, out for a good time and to showcase Poly’s vulnerabilities for the greater good.
“I hope my life can be composed of unique adventures, so I like to learn and hack everything in order to fight against the fate,” the hacker wrote in messages that can be viewed on a blockchain. Working out the blind spot of Poly Network “would be one of the best moments in my life,” said the hacker, who has yet to be identified.
As the incident unfolded this week, the hacker dubbed ‘Mr White Hat’ sent communiqués via the Ethereum blockchain, which can be viewed publicly. The blockchain conversation reveals part of the hacker’s negotiations with Poly Network and gives some clues to the motivation behind the theft.
Here are some extracts from those messages:
“Not so interested in money, now considering returning some tokens or just leaving them here.” — Mr White Hat“We can offer you a security bounty when you return all the remaining assets. We will provide a secure address through email.” — Poly Network
“I have been exploring the meaning of life for a while.” — Mr White Hat
“I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn’t they learn something from those hacks?” — Mr White Hat“Q: Why hacking? A. For fun :) ” — Mr White Hat
After quoting German philosopher Martin Heidegger, the hacker then took on a Batman-style vigilante attitude. “I prefer to work in the dark and save the world,” they wrote.To some, a homespun philosophy that mixed high and pop culture to justify taking $600m may seem a stretch. The DeFi market already had a reputation for being the wildest of the “Wild West” in the largely unregulated crypto world. Last year, DeFi represented only 6 per cent of all cryptocurrency activity but accounted for a third of all digital asset thefts, according to Chainalysis, a crypto data company.
But as the dust began to settle, many crypto enthusiasts, a community that has long championed libertarian ideals, were already beginning to give him a sympathetic hearing. It had even given the hacker a nickname — “Mr White Hat” — in reference to supposed “ethical” hacking.
“The world has up to now been too forgiving of people deploying insecure systems which companies manage rather than fix. The wonderful thing about DeFi is that it is not forgiving in that way,” said Mark Miller, chief technology officer at Agoric, which provides software for DeFi transactions.
“We have an ecosystem here in which insecure participants get killed quickly so it gets to be populated by the survivors of the process.”
The anonymous hacker’s sudden rise to fame began on Tuesday, after he identified a weak spot in Poly’s systems.
Poly had developed a computer protocol, or set of rules, that allows users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network. Many of the world’s most widely used blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, operate independently. Their coins, offered as an incentive to users, run on separate technologies.
That means investors cannot easily move tokens to a different blockchain to trade them elsewhere. Poly acted as a bridge but Mr White Hat found a bug that gave him direct access the ledgers.
Shortly after 1.30pm London time, Poly alerted the world on Twitter that thousands of tokens had been removed from its network. Its response was to publish the unique alphanumeric addresses of the wallets to which the tokens had been sent, so other crypto players could identify and potentially block further transactions.
Exchanges such as Binance and OKEx said they were monitoring the situation. Tether, the stablecoin operator, said it froze about $33m worth of its tokens. As the exchanges at the heart of the crypto system began to block the hacker’s path, the adventure took yet another turn.&nbsp;
Users of the Ethereum blockchain can create crypto trades and attach comments for the world to see. The hacker’s helpful informant used this feature to warn Mr White Hat the assets were being locked off. Others began tipping Mr White Hat with tokens, accompanied by messages asking for funds to be returned. While most tips were worth less than $1, a handful of the more than 1,300 transactions involved tokens worth hundreds of dollars in the hope of receiving a more substantial payout.
Poly left a message on Ethereum asking the hacker to contact them. Less than an hour later, Mr White Hat responded on the same channel. Attacker and target were communicating in public.
In more conciliatory language, Poly then offered a bounty worth $500,000 as a reward for finding the bug and returning the assets. “We hope it will be remembered as the biggest white hat hack in history,” the organisation said.
The appeal to the hacker’s vanity worked. He gave no indication he would take the money but, the next day, began transferring small amounts to a joint account. Like a police negotiator in a movie, Poly encouraged the hacker to continue: “You are moving things [in] the right direction.”
By Friday, Poly said almost all of the funds had been returned and it was preparing to take full control of the assets to hand back to their owners. As the hacker surrendered, the thief remained defiant; “Hacking for good, I did save the project”, he wrote via Ethereum.
For some the episode had represented an important lesson about the fallibilities of the system, especially protocols that look to connect blockchains like Poly. “A blockchain can be extremely secure but only in its own world. The moment it needs to talk to something else outside the blockchain that potentially opens up problems,” said Kevin Werbach, an academic at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.
Lawyers said it was unclear whether users whose funds were caught up in the caper would or even could launch a legal challenge. Poly’s website offers no terms governing its use, nor does it reference a legal entity.
DeFi systems use software programs called smart contracts to transfer cryptocurrencies, removing any human intermediary and complicating the task of assigning liability to any one party. Some developers have argued that the rules created by software programs constitute the “law” — a notion that many lawyers contest.
But it may be the hacker who has the biggest impact on how aggressively regulators look to supervise DeFi activity, said Charlie Steele, a former US government lawyer and now partner at Forensic Risk Alliance, a regulation consultancy. “I don’t think regulators would be too comfortable relying on Robin Hoods out there to police the system.”

"DCC: piles of cash, heaps of debt and not much interest",DCC PLC,"DCC is a company we care about because you probably don’t.
In spite of being a FTSE 100 fixture with an enterprise value of nearly £5.5bn, the Dublin-based oils-to-splints-to-cameras distributor rarely attracts much attention. Full-year results released today have been picked up by the Irish press and ignored by nearly everyone else. On LSE’s website the statement was the day’s 20th most-read RNS, trailing behind relative minnows including Shoe Zone, Angling Direct and toilet paper maker Accrol.
Here at FT Alphaville we care about DCC because it’s weird. Some ways in which DCC is weird were highlighted in a long post in February, to which we’ll add one chart:
Odd, right? Why would a company keep borrowing huge amounts of cash year after year just to park it in the bank?
DCC says it maintains a strong balance sheet for “many strategic and commercial benefits”, including to provide nimbleness around acquisitions and opportunistic investments. At the March year end it had £1.4bn of cash ready to deploy, as well as more room to borrow. Net debt (excluding leases) had risen from £419.9mn the year before on the back of 19 acquisitions but remained fairly low at £767.3mn, or about 0.9 times Ebitda.
Flexibility is expensive, however. DCC’s net interest expense before exceptional items rose from £54.1mn in the 2022 fiscal year to £80.6mn in 2023. In effect, the company paid £96.7mn in interest to earn £16.1mn in interest.
It might also seem a bit surprising, given all the idle money sitting around, that DCC uses reverse factoring. Per the results:
DCC Technology selectively uses supply chain financing solutions to sell, on a non-recourse basis, a portion of its receivables relating to certain higher volume supply chain/sales and marketing activities. The level of supply chain financing at 31 March 2023 decreased by £16.9 million to £151.1 million (2022: £168.0 million). Supply chain financing had a positive impact on Group working capital days of 2.3 days (31 March 2022: 2.3 days).
This is only slightly odd. Electronics suppliers often use supply chain financing when extending credit to large retailers, with DCC first disclosing the strategy in 2012 as part of an international expansion drive. It’s also a small facility in the context of the group, whose receivables balance was £2.3bn at the 2023 year end.
Nevertheless, when an ongoing contract dispute in the US has raised allegations about irregular book-keeping at the same division, and when there’s already £1.4bn on hand that’s earning less than nothing, invoice sales that quicken working capital conversion by two days and seven hours might appear a bit unnecessary. Why bother?
(Asked about reverse factoring, DCC did not offer a comment.)
To be sure, working capital can be lumpy for all distribution businesses. DCC’s fuels operations provide 70 per cent of group earnings and are heavily reliant on the winter months; the period-end cash snapshots in September and March may not fully capture movements in stuff like inventories and advance prepayments.
The ultimate test is whether a business keeps throwing off cash, which DCC definitely does. A total recommended dividend for 2023 of 187.21p per share means, according to the company, the 29th consecutive year of growth:
And yet. For a company that’s as focused on returns as DCC to keep leaving so much on the table in the form of costly cash reserves seems . . . well, it's all just a little bit weird.

US grabs majority of euro swaps trading after Brexit rift,Derivatives,"The US has cornered the majority of trades in the $100tn euro swap market as the stand off between London and Brussels over financial services pushed traders to send more of their deals to New York.
The swap market is used by investors to trade derivatives, as a hedge against sudden moves in interest rates and currencies. In March US venues took just over half of the market, the first time they had recorded the majority of activity.
Stock and bond prices shifted rapidly in March as investors fretted over the pace of global interest rate rises while jitters hung over the banking market following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse.
As markets moved rapidly, traders in Europe increasingly turned to the US to find a counterparty, according to data from Osttra, a UK post trade services company.
While the US’s market share hit 51 per cent, EU venues held a 35 per cent slice of the market, their lowest since December 2020. The UK market slumped to just 14 per cent, Osttra found. Before Brexit, Britain accounted for more than 70 per cent of the market.
The outflow has been accelerated by a stand-off between London and Brussels since the end of the Brexit transition period in January 2021, which has fractured the market.Both sides have insisted that the banks and brokers they oversee must trade the most liquid and standard swaps on marketplaces they regulate.
To bolster their markets after Brexit, neither side legally recognised the trading venues in each other’s market — even though their rules were virtually identical.
Unable to use each other’s markets traders have increasingly sent their deals to US venues, known as “swap execution facilities”, because Britain and the EU deem American standards legally acceptable.
This has resulted in US-based venues, run by companies such as Tradeweb, Bloomberg and TP ICAP, gobbling up trading that used to take place in Europe.
“March was very busy, there was a lot more activity,” said Kirston Winters, chief risk officer at Osttra. “What’s really interesting with this widening is some of this will be mandated volume and some of it is voluntary volume,” he said.
He added that most marketplace operators “have three versions of themselves now, a US, UK and EU version. They’re having to run liquidity pools on each of those. Having to go to lots of places hunting for liquidity can’t be a good thing.”
The market for euro swaps has swelled in the last year as the European Central Bank has aggressively lifted interest rates to combat inflation. Deals with a notional value of $106tn were struck in the first quarter of the year, according to Isda, the trade body, a 24 per cent jump compared to the same time last year.
The derivatives market has become a hot point of contention between the UK and EU. European authorities have been pushing European banks to process more of their euro derivatives deals through clearing houses in the bloc, rather than through London. But the banks have resisted because they fear it would cost billions of dollars in extra costs and also threaten financial stability."
"A comprehensive taxonomy of central bank logos, with jokes",Design,"According to the Bank for International Settlements, there are 166 central banks and monetary authorities in the world, excluding the various US Federal Reserve districts.
They vary hugely in size and power, but have one crucial thing in common: all have logos.
What should a logo convey? Power, authority, history? Accessibility, transparency, modernity? A predatory animal? It turns out there’s a really huge range of answers to this questions, which central banks have answered with varying degrees of finesse.
We’ve created a taxonomy of all 166, with notes on some particular interesting specimens. If you have coffee or painkillers (or both), now’s the time to consume them.
Of three primary shapes — square, triangle and circle — it is the last that “points most clearly to the fourth dimension” wrote Kandinsky.
What relevance, if any, this has to central banking is unclear, but it’s clear lots of central banks like to get a round (logo).
Let’s take a moment to appreciate the sheer variety on display in this initial tranche, from the near-minimalist hipster chique of Botswana to, uh, Barbados. Burundi looks like the logo from an old-school pizzeria, sorry.
Straight out of the gate, Da Afghanistan Bank sets a pace that few can hope to rival.
Sure, at first glance it looks like the label of an overpriced bottle of olive oil you’d grab in the departures lounge of a Greek airport, but a closer look yields wonderful details: the curiously-shaped horse riders, and the cash-packed horns that look like a vanquished croissant piñata.
Barbados comes in two contrasting flavours. Website visitors get the more reserved, staid flavour seen on the right here, while in other places — such as the bank’s YouTube channel — the full force of the fish is unleashed, including dodgy outline and gradient background.
Side by side, we couldn’t help but be reminded of the “My sister and I are polar opposites” meme. We suppose it’s a case of picking the right fish for the job, but one’s a bit dull and the other’s kinda bonkers, so we know which we prefer.
Once again, a circle can contain multitudes. Before we get into it — imagining you didn’t already know — which of these fifteen would you guess is one of the world’s most important central banks? Bet it’s not the one that looks like the logo of an overpriced railway station kiosk.
There are some interesting contrasts to draw in this tranche: Eswatini and Ghana both take on the coin aesthetic with very different results. Greece and Guatemala are likewise similar-but-oh-so-different, while Iraq looks like a better executed version of Honduras.
Georgia and Ireland are both interesting, shattering the tried-and-tested “our name in a circle” approach to aim for interesting abstractions, while the Hong Kong Monetary Authority simply ops for the city’s emblematic bauhinia flower.
Let’s take a moment to appreciate Guatemala though. First up: love the typography (and we love typography). The weirdness initially seems to be the bird, but really we think what’s throwing this off is the super-detailed temple — it looks like someone just took a much larger image of a temple, downscaled it too much, and stuck a bird on it. The effect is a bit kaiju-y.
First thing’s first, yes the logo of the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia is literally a badly-cropped photo of a coin. We don’t understand either.
Again, glorious diversity abounds. Japan has a wonderful old-timey-stamp vibe, South Korea looks like a payments company, Maldives looks like . . . actually we’re not going to say. The Mongolian central bank logo looks like it’s copied from the wrapping on some complementary hotel soap. The thing as the middle of Nicaragua is a phrygian cap, apparently.
A lot of central banks — particularly those insecure Americans — have chucked scary apex-predator birds on the logo. Phwoar, so vigilant. Mauritius, in contrast, has gone for the dodo, the extinct bird once endemic to that island. One for the birding guide?
There’s a school of thought in graphic design that a truly great logo must be so simple that even a child could draw it. A child could not draw the logo of the Nepal Rastra Bank. That does not mean that it does not slap. It slaps.
There’s so much to take in. Poland’s logo is the most nondescript thing we have ever seen. Portugal’s looks like the Bank of England’s except it’s halfway through the shoot and the model is trying to tell her friend which jacket she left her phone in.
Russia’s is . . . the Imperium of Man (one’s a fascist autocracy that clings desperately to the glories of a greater age, the other’s from Warhammer 40k etc…)? Rwanda looks like it was made using PowerPoint. Sierra Leone looks like the badge of middling Italian football club (ie amazing). We’re very charmed by Slovakia (its website currently has a cutesy animated version).
While trying to find a higher-res version of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we initially thought their website must have been showing the older version. Amazingly, the hyper-detailed quasi-skeuomorphoglossy one is actually the newer one. Per CNN: “[Governor] Diokno said the logo refresh meant to introduce ‘renewed vitality’ and underscore the ‘integrity and competence’ of the institution, in line with the BSP’s 2020-2023 strategy.” Well OK then.
We round off the circles with some heavy-hitters, including the Bank of England’s new “more in line with our values” (read: pile of money gone) Britannia, and the Federal Reserve thick-thighed eagle. Venezuela’s got a nice art deco tinge, Uzbekistan looks like New Balance marketed at Gen Z, and Zimbabwe reminds us of The Chronic (1992).
Tajikistan seems to have attempted a minimalist rabbit-duck illusion approach, where a viewer might see a mountain range or an eagle. It doesn’t quite work though: we’re left wondering why a) there’s a mountain with legs or b) the eagle is sniffing its armpit like it’s not sure whether it remembered to use deodorant.
Suriname’s logo contains eight arrows, divided into two groups: four filled arrows that point inwards at a diagonal, and four outlined arrows that point outwards at right angles. We don’t know what this means but it’s certainly highly provocative. And maybe that’s what really matters.
As demonstrated, the circle is a solid but versatile starting point for a central bank logo. Yet sometimes in life, you have to do things differently, but just not very differently.
These logos are almost circles, or imply circularity without actually achieving it. We’re not sure that’s a meaningful enough distinction to make a whole other category, and hope you agree.
With the fraying of circularity comes pain and pleasure. Albania looks awful. Lots of CBs love laurels. Bank of Jamaica is a crocodile with a key in its mouth, which is undeniably dope, but it also looks slightly like one of those big pennies you’d press at an old-timey museum.
Things that Iceland’s groovy logo could also be for: a recently-reopened Northern European tourist information centre, a packet of expensive but delicious rye-crackers with generous chunks of sea salt, a speciality coffee shop, something involving CBD, an art gallery in a seaside town undergoing gentrification.
Acronymisation has long had a role in power dynamics. Make something an acronym, and you have a shorthand that delineates a binary of “knows” and “don’t knows”.
This often means that acronym logos have an air of exclusion, and contempt. Not all of them though. Some are just whimsical.
There are sub-taxonomies here: Aruba and Luxembourg in the regional travel company box; Mexico, Moldova and Peru (maybe) could all be luxury brands; Haiti and Montenegro look like management consultancies. Austria integrates the euro symbol with significantly more grace than the ECB managed.
Belarus is the standout, however. Why its central bank logo looks like a hotel that hasn’t had a brand refresh since the 1980s is unclear, but it’s giving off irresistible towels-included energy, right down to the middling burgundy tones. They’re truly making swish happen.
Rounding out this category we have a serious “find the letter” puzzle going on. Banca Națională a României, OK. Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası, clear enough. But Narodna Banka Srbije: ???
Trinidad and Tobago is great though. In a simple shape it conveys a C, a B, an &amp; [ampersand symbol], and suggests everything is tied together. It would be cool if there were also somehow twin Ts in there, but you can have too much of a good thing (unless that thing is analysis of CB logos).
It’s a testament to the relative youth of the central bank as an institutional concept that crests aren’t more prevalent in CB iconography — presumably most, by dint of being created in the 19th or 20th centuries, are design anachronisms. Anyway . ..
Even within this slightly more constricted category, imagination abounds — Malaysia’s central bank was founded nearly a full decade after the far more ornate Malta. There’s some incredible gradient action happening — particularly on Kenya, which looks almost three-dimensional. We’re not iconography experts (in case that’s not already extremely clear), but the concentration of powerful animals seems notably higher here than in the circles.
In 1968, the Beatles released Abbey Road and Malta applied to have these hench-looking knights represent their new central bank. We suppose that if anywhere has any excuse for such an medieval logo, it’s Malta. You can find out more about how it was devised (in a process that includes vellum and the Duke of Norfolk) on the bank’s website. Is it over the top? Definitely yes. Is that OK? Yeah, sure.
Square is of course a synonym for uncool, and we’ve got to say this tranche is . . . maybe a little boring. But there are some gems.
Armenia’s logo is kinda 3D. You go, Armenia! Canada, Croatia and Dominican Republic all aim for the same kinda ground and end up looking like they’re from a map key. Kyrgyzstan looks like an upmarket property developer, and Lebanon looks like it’s from a nature reserve factbox sign. Apologies for the potato quality on San Marino. OK, Norway’s should probably be in the letter category but mainly it’s BORING, just like everything from Snoreway (ed: oi watch it).
Morocco’s not-quite-a-square square logo captures some of the same freehand whimsy that makes 3i one of Alphaville’s favourite corporate logos. There a fine line (literally) between lackadaisical and whimsy, and this seems to stay on the right side of things. The calligraphy within reads “MB”, meaning there may be some crossover with the “logos that are letters” category here. The colour choice: Premier Inn.
Who really needs a logo anyway? These are central banks, not web design agencies or PE firms. There is a swath of central banks — notably several that are integrating calligraphic version of their name, that have decided a picture is not worth a handful of words, and settled for wordmarks instead.
You have to admire the Swiss approach. Have a country with loads of different official languages? Just write out your name in every single one. Chuck in English too, why not? Slovenia looks like the logo for a real-time-strategy game set in ancient Rome.
Here’s the logo of the Bank of Spain next to the logo for Roche Bobois, Carmela Soprano’s favourite French furniture and home accessories retailer.
All it needs is M A D R I D underneath to complete the look. ¡Que chique!
. . . and the rest. Some central banks simply can’t be tamed, leading to several logos that are either highly abstract or just completely buck wild.
[Full transparency: you’ll probably notice some logos in this category that could/should have been in other categories, to which we respond: at least we tried.]
There’s too much variety here for broad impressions, so we’ll do this saccades-style. Australia looks like an illegal fidget spinner. Cape Verde looks like that scene in Inception when the earth folds, except in this case Leonardo DiCaprio is a coin. China has strong evil-corporation-in-cyberpunk-dystopia vibes — which, you know, tracks.
Ecuador’s logo is the Golden sun of La Tolita, an damaged artefact of pre-Columbian civilisation. As far as we can tell, it’s a photo rather than a rendering: either way, it breaks several of the boring rules about what a logo should be — transferable, scalable to small sizes, equally at home in colour or greyscale — in favour of something very different. We do, however, feel for any Ecuadorean child asked to draw their country’s central bank logo in class.
Ignore your eyes. Do not succumb to the cheap thrills of bright colours, or shape. Look to the top left. Look to Latvia. And ask: in a world where central bank logos can be anything, why not be the top fringe of a dead, grey sun rising over the horizon of a post-apocalyptic planet?
Elsewhere, it’s a hodgepodge of birds, weapons, buildings and . . . a pen? Bless Ukraine but their central bank logo looks like antivirus software. Panama reached for the most obvious words to insert after “Panama” and decided “canal” was more fitting than “hat” or “tax scandal”.
Well, we can’t say the takeaways from this waste of your time, our time and Louis’s waning youth in-depth investigation are particularly clear, but at least as Alphaville sets up its own central bank (alongside our equity research and public relations wings), we have plenty of inspiration to draw from. What are the key features?

Deutsche Börse and TP ICAP join rush to entice crypto investors,Deutsche Borse AG,"The rush to profit from crypto assets has swept along two more big names in traditional financial markets, indicating that efforts from regulators to bring the nascent industry under tighter supervision has done little to damp large investors’ interest.
UK interdealer broker TP ICAP and German exchange operator Deutsche Börse both announced initiatives on Tuesday aimed at drawing banks and hedge funds towards using recognised and regulated brands for crypto trading, as global authorities take a closer look at the workings of the nearly $2tn market.
Deutsche Börse paid an undisclosed sum for a majority stake in digital asset management company Crypto Finance, which was launched in 2017 by former UBS banker Jan Brzezek. Regulated by Swiss authorities, the company provides trading and custody services for institutional investors.
“It’s a strategic investment,” said Paul Hilgers managing director of Deutsche Börse’s cash market.
The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has fallen sharply in recent weeks after China launched the latest round of crackdowns on private digital coins in May. Since then, both the global banking regulator and the association of the world’s central banks have issued stinging reports dismissing crypto assets as risky and without much use.

In late June, the UK’s financial regulator banned Binance, one of the largest crypto trading platforms, from offering regulated products in the country.
At the same time authorities have also drawn up standards that would give banks greater clarity on the impact of buying and holding assets such as ethereum and bitcoin, recommending the most stringent capital requirements be held against the volatile assets. Those moves have fuelled rather than damped the appetite of large and established companies to enter a market that is still largely unregulated.
Initially Crypto Finance will allow Deutsche Börse’s clients to access and trade cryptocurrency markets, but there are plans to potentially launch a trading platform for these assets as well, Hilgers said.
“Digital assets will transform the financial industry. There is increasing demand from established financial institutions who are looking to become active in this new asset class and want a trusted partner,” said Thomas Book, executive board member for trading and clearing at Deutsche Börse.
The move comes only a day after Germany’s financial watchdog issued its first licence to trade and custody crypto assets to US crypto exchange Coinbase.
London-based broker TP ICAP has also jumped into the crypto space with plans to set up a wholesale cryptocurrency trading platform together with Dutch high-frequency trader Flow Traders and two digital asset custodians, Fidelity Digital Assets and Zodia Custody. The company has applied for registration with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
TP ICAP said investors sometimes held back because many crypto exchanges needed to be paid in full up front for their deals, while also acting as a custodian for the asset.
It created a conflict of interest, said Simon Forster, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP. But he added that banks and hedge funds were increasingly choosing to plough ahead with trading rather than just think about it.
“Clients want to get access to this new market and they want to engage with it,” he said. “We consider crypto a new asset class.”"
How ZIRP phenomenon Vice lost its grip,Digital Media,"Yesterday, Vice finally filed for bankruptcy, and with it we have a declaration from its chief restructuring officer Frank Pometti, hired from AlixPartners to oversee the carcass of the hipper-than-thou media empire.
Sadly the CRO’s declaration isn’t quite an FTX-style “lol this is the maddest thing I’ve ever seen”, but it doesn’t paint a favourable light of a company once valued at nearly $6bn in the zero-rates era.
Basically, the company was a very trendy, very fun, very elaborate cash incinerator, according to Pometti’s filing.
Like many other growth companies in the media and technology sectors, VICE has been cash flow negative for the past several years. As a result, VICE relied on external funding, raising both debt and equity capital to fuel its rapid growth and to fund expenses in certain parts of its businesses. Although these fund-raising efforts helped to finance VICE’s growth, they ultimately led to the Company being burdened by a highly leveraged and unusually complex capital structure.
As current market dynamics trended against the Debtors, the substantial funded debt obligations, dividend requirements from its various classes of preferred stock, and other non-operational expenses and obligations, severely constrained liquidity and interfered with VICE’s ability to raise additional capital. The lack of liquidity was particularly problematic for VICE given the ongoing capital requirements arising from the fact that the majority of its businesses operate across platforms that require near constant innovation and adaption to new technologies, and the development of content which requires upfront investment and often takes multiple years to generate returns.
Prometti later gives some more details. Vice’s sins seem to go all the way back to at least the 2017 financing round, when it raised $450mn from the likes of TPG at a frankly mental-even-at-the-time $5.7bn valuation.
The money was mostly raised through preference shares that paid fixed dividends, but just got pumped into financing growth that never really materialised. As a result, Vice struggled to generate profits to service its financial obligations for years before it finally succumbed to bankruptcy.
As Vice’s CRO says, with our emphasis:
In 2017, following the issuance of significant amounts of Preferred Stock, the Company invested significant capital in content, operations and infrastructure that did not provide an immediate return and resulted in significant losses and increased expenses. In 2019 the Company raised additional capital to fund ongoing operations, non-operating expenses and liabilities and operational restructurings. This left the Company saddled with a significant amount of leverage in the form of the Prepetition Senior Secured Term Loans, Senior Subordinated Notes and Preferred Stock. Complicating the Company’s financial situation was the fact that it did not generate sufficient free cash flow to pay its debts and continued to operate at a loss for several years prior to the Petition Date.
By 2022, Vice was tapping its investors for money at an almost monthly clip. Which must have been fun for the CFO and the company’s shareholders.
Beginning in early 2022, to address cash shortfalls, Vice Parent issued several series of subordinated unsecured notes, as issuer, to the Senior Preferred Shareholders, as purchasers (the “Subsequent Subordinated Notes” and, together with the Initial Subordinated Notes, the “Senior Subordinated Notes”). The Subsequent Subordinated Notes were issued in various series, which respectively were dated February 25, 2022, April 29, 2022, May 27, 2022, June 14, 2022, August 2, 2022, August 12, 2022, August 26, 2022, August 29, 2022, September 13, 2022, November 2, 2022, and November 14, 2022.
Anyway, read the full filing if you want more details on how Vice cast around desperately for a buyer and how the bankruptcy finally came about, or you just want to ogle at organisational charts like this one:"
Central banks bow to the inevitability of digital currencies,Digital currencies,"The writer is a professor at Cornell, senior fellow at Brookings, and author of ‘The Future of Money’&nbsp;
The future of retail and peer-to-peer payments is undoubtedly digital. As the use of cash plunges around the world, central bank digital currencies are an inevitable part of this transition.
Most central banks are bowing to this reality, either experimenting with or preparing the ground for CBDCs — as instruments for broadening financial access, increasing payment system resilience and ensuring monetary sovereignty. Even as these digital tokens gain momentum, however, the case for them has weakened.What has changed?In the first place, the landscape looks less promising in practice than it did in theory a couple of years ago. China, Brazil and India are undertaking trials but face scant demand for their CBDCs, as they already have excellent digital payment systems. Sweden’s Riksbank has concluded a multiyear pilot but a parliamentary committee has found no pressing need for an e-krona. Nigeria’s eNaira has been a flop, although recent cash shortages have increased its usage.
The official response to the financial distress precipitated by Silicon Valley Bank’s failure in the US has also indirectly highlighted concern that retail CBDCs could deplete bank deposits. A simple safeguard against disintermediation of banks is to limit the amounts that can be held in CBDC digital wallets. But as evident from the lifting of deposit insurance caps when depositors lost confidence in some banks, a limit on CBDC digital wallets might prove difficult to sustain at a time of crisis and could precipitate a banking meltdown.
Conspiracy theories are also heating up, built on legitimate concerns about the privacy implications of CBDCs. Far-sighted Florida governor Ron DeSantis has pre-emptively banned the use of as-yet nonexistent digital dollars in his state. But, given their inevitability, what principles should guide the next phase of CBDC development?
First, clarity about the value proposition for users. In many countries, there simply isn’t demand for central bank money for retail payments. China’s payment giants (Alipay, WeChat Pay) and India’s Unified Payments Interface have made low-cost digital payments easily and widely available. In the US, the Federal Reserve’s instant payment service FedNow will increase the system’s efficiency and resilience.
Still, a well-designed CBDC could play an incremental role in catalysing payments innovation. Other advantages, such as the ability to facilitate payments using near-field communication even when cellular and wireless networks are down, could also be played up.
Second, design choices could make the balance of risks more favourable. Central banks would provide the digital tokens and commercial banks custodial services for CBDC digital wallets in the two-tier system that underlies most CBDC experiments. A fee schedule could discourage large transfers to the wallets, while regulatory changes make it easier for banks to cope with shifts from their deposit accounts to CBDC wallets without precipitating liquidity shortages. New cryptographic technologies can help alleviate privacy concerns and make it possible to verify the bona fides of users without compromising transactional privacy.
Third, the introduction of a CBDC should be determined by capacity and institutional constraints. Nigeria forged ahead without adequate infrastructure to support the eNaira, limiting its adoption. There is some advantage to waiting and learning from the experiences of others. The notion that a successful digital renminbi would set a global standard and shake the dollar’s dominance is far-fetched. The US has made its potential CBDC design available as open-source code and it is unlikely any significant country will adopt the digital renminbi’s architecture simply because it was ahead in the game&nbsp;
For smaller countries with weak central banks, quicker adoption would help maintain sovereignty over domestic payments. A CBDC by itself will not make up for a central bank’s lack of credibility, though.
Fourth, there is a strong case for wholesale CBDCs, for interbank payment and settlement within and across national borders, to reduce frictions in international payments.
Retail CBDCs do have advantages over cash, broadening the tax base and limiting the use of central bank money for illicit activities, and even over private digital payment systems — lower cost, easier access, interoperability across platforms. CBDCs might be inevitable as cash disappears, but central banks need to structure them to make them worthwhile and leave the design choices flexible enough to incorporate technological changes that mitigate the risks.

Banknotes have characteristics a digital euro can never acquire&nbsp;/&nbsp;From Ignazio Angeloni and Daniel Gros, Italy"
Using crypto for crime is not a bug — it’s an industry feature,Digital currencies,"One of the (many) times I have been heckled during a panel on crypto was when I argued that it shouldn’t be thought of as money. The only reason to use it other than for speculation, I said, was to buy drugs on the internet. This was a preposterous idea, the heckler retorted; crypto is used for so much more than that.
Crypto enthusiasts argue that it’s wrong to claim that it enables crime because the technology itself is “neutral” so cannot be blamed for any illicit activity. But this simply isn’t true: crypto was designed as a censorship-resistant payment mechanism that operates outside the traditional financial system and beyond the remit of regulators. Crypto transactions are not subjected to the same fraud detection, anti-money laundering or suspicious activity checks that traditional ones are. Operating outside the system is its very raison d’être. And one only has to look at how the crypto industry behaves to see that crime is not a bug; it’s a feature.
Take the world’s biggest crypto exchange Binance, for instance. In a lawsuit filed last month against the exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges that Binance’s former chief compliance officer said of certain Binance customers: “Like come on. They are here for crime.” The exchange’s money laundering reporting officer, according to the CFTC, agreed: “We see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.”
It would be funny if it weren’t so flagrant. “These exchanges know exactly what they’re doing,” Stephen Diehl, co-author of Popping the Crypto Bubble, tells me. “They’re basically creating a dark transnational payment network and, not surprisingly, that will be used by criminals. They’re purpose-built for that.”
Last year was a turbulent year for crypto, with collapsing prices wiping about $1.5tn from the industry’s “market cap” and with several high-profile businesses imploding. But despite the market downturn, it was also a record year for crypto-based crime: illicit crypto transactions topped $20bn in 2022, according to data analytics firm Chainalysis, up from $18bn the previous year, after a huge increase in transactions involving companies targeted by US sanctions (the majority coming from Russian-based exchange Garantex). Ransomware attacks were down a little on the year, but still accounted for almost half a billion dollars.
Not only is that figure a “lower-bound estimate” — the number is very likely to grow over time as the company identifies new crypto wallet addresses associated with unlawful activity — but it also only includes “on-chain” activity, meaning only transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. It wouldn’t include, therefore, the “massive fraud” that allegedly took place at crypto exchange FTX, nor the proceeds of drug trafficking in which crypto has been used as the means of payment.
Nor does the figure include $23.8bn worth of money laundered via crypto in 2022 — a 68 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. In the UK alone, the National Crime Agency estimates that over $1bn of illicit cash is transferred overseas using crypto each year.
“What we’re seeing is that crypto is used as part of the money-laundering methodology now — it’s integrated into it,” says Adrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre. Searle says that while the proportion of money laundering done in crypto is still relatively low, it is expected to increase rapidly, and is facilitating international criminal networks on an unprecedented scale.
Crypto backers like to argue that crypto can be used for good, too. This is true enough — Blockchain data analytics company Elliptic told the FT this month that $200mn in crypto has been donated to pro-Ukraine causes since the war broke out, with more than $80mn of that sent directly to the Ukrainian government.
But that has to be put in context: the positives will always be outweighed by the negatives. Of the estimated $3.8bn worth of crypto that was stolen by hackers last year — another new record — some $1.7bn was stolen by North Korea-linked hackers, according to Chainalysis. This money is channelled, the UN claims, into the country’s ballistic missile programme.
On the Dark Web — which is “predicated on the use of cryptocurrency”, according to DCI Phil McInerney, who leads on cyber crime at the National Police Chiefs’ Council — crypto is used not just to buy and sell illegal substances, but 3D-printed firearms, compromised banking credentials, forged documents and child sexual abuse materials.
So in a funny way, my heckler was right: crypto isn’t just used for speculating on and buying drugs on the internet: it’s used for much murkier criminal activities, too.

A new experiment in blended finance,ESG investing,"This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.
Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT
Greetings from Washington where the Financial Times is about to hold its US Weekend Festival. This year I am moderating a special panel on the backlash to environmental, social and governance themes, with Roy Swan from the Ford Foundation and Zeynep Ton from MIT; there will be a lot to discuss given the degree to which Republicans keep raising the stakes in the anti-ESG fight — to the consternation of some US corporate boards (and, of course, the wider world). Email me with questions to ask.
Meanwhile, in today’s newsletter we look at a striking example of public-private partnership that has just emerged, and which might spark debate at the World Bank as its new leader Ajay Banga arrives at the helm; doubly so since Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is due to host a summit with Mia Mottley, leader of Barbados, in Paris next month to promote reform in global financial architecture. We will be writing more about this so-called Bridgetown Initiative in the coming weeks.
And check out our story below, which gives a new (more optimistic) slant on how artificial intelligence is changing the business world. Or for more cheer, look at the future of sustainable fish. As ever, let us know what you think. (Gillian Tett)
In recent months we have written extensively about the World Bank — and the widespread criticism it has faced from environmental activists and US Democratic politicians regarding its perceived failure to finance the green transition in poor countries. And now that Ajay Banga has been formally announced as the Bank’s new head, replacing David Malpass, expectations are sky-high that the institution will soon unveil some big policy changes — and that Banga will work his magic to push these through.
He will face a monumental challenge to deliver on these hopes, particularly as a Bank outsider. But as the reform debate bubbles on, it is worth widening the lens beyond the World Bank, to see what other multi-development banks are doing.
Take the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Unlike some other MDBs, it has seen the volume of “blended finance” deals (ie those that use public funds to de-risk private investments) rise slightly in recent years, albeit from a low base. And this week it unveiled a new twist: a joint project between the EBRD, the EU and the emerging market asset manager ILX to support “sustainable development, particularly in climate-smart solutions, digital transformation and financial inclusion” in eastern Europe.
The idea is that the projects will be guaranteed by the EU, supported and organised by the EBRD, and ILX — which is mostly backed by Dutch pension money — will invest alongside it. Strictly speaking, this is not classic “blended finance”, since the ILX private sector investment is ring-fenced; but it is a striking variation on the concept. And although the original project is a mere $300mn in size, it could be scaled up in the future — if it works.
“[This] sets down a new marker in development finance,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission executive vice-president, who hopes this will be “a new model that can inspire other international financial institutions and private investors to step up sustainable and green investment”. More specifically, since the EU has now embarked on a “Gateway” strategy, which aims to make $300bn investments in green project by 2027, it is eager to attract private funds with projects like this.
Of course, if developing nations are to receive the support they require to tackle climate change, blended finance projects will eventually need to involve trillions, not millions, of dollars. And the question of how to get those trillions moving remains a very tricky issue, which will be a major topic for discussion at next month’s summit in Paris to discuss Mia Mottley’s “Bridgetown Initiative”. But the EBRD-ILX deal at least shows that experimentation is heating up. That is a good thing. (Gillian Tett)
US technology giants have been big winners in the sustainable investing movement over the past few years, and dominate the top spots in most environmental, social and governance funds.
But now the tech behemoths face a clean energy reckoning as their artificial intelligence products devour increasingly huge amounts of electricity.
In a comparison of four models used for natural language processing in AI, GPT-3, the tool created by OpenAI, consumed the most energy and spewed the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to a Stanford University report published this year. (And GPT-3 has already been superseded by a still more powerful model.)
Microsoft — the most widely held stock in ESG funds — has invested $10bn in OpenAI, fuelling an AI race among technology giants.
“If artificial intelligence is going to scale at the level that is being talked about in headlines today, the two biggest things that are required are more data centres around the world, and very, very significant increases in electricity to power those data centres,” Connor Teskey, president of Brookfield Asset Management, told investors this month.&nbsp;
Data storage providers are also rushing to offer products that save energy and can keep emissions down for AI users.
Pure Storage, which makes storage systems for data centres, is helping Meta build an AI supercomputer. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the company expects to roll out new AI products in the months ahead.
Pure Storage argues that its solid-state storage drives can cut energy use and cooling needs when compared with conventional spinning hard disks.&nbsp;
“Our job in this world is to make the storage and data management footprint as power-efficient as possible,” said Robert Lee, Pure Storage’s chief technology officer.
Some technology companies have already identified data storage as a problematic source of carbon. CrowdStrike, a cyber-security company, has said it is seeking to place data centres closer to renewable energy supplies. At game-maker Activision Blizzard, 71 per cent of its data centre electricity consumption comes from renewable energy and the company will only move into new facilities that are run on 100 per cent clean energy, a spokesman told me.
Lawmakers are also taking notice of the emissions from data centres. Representatives in Oregon this year proposed a bill that would require these facilities to cut emissions by 60 per cent by 2027.
The bill failed to pass this year, but as AI draws increasing scrutiny to this issue, regulations hitting data centre emissions are about to become more common. (Patrick Temple-West)

A striking €2bn bet on hydrogen,ESG investing,"This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.
Visit our Moral Money hub for all the latest ESG news, opinion and analysis from around the FT
Hello from London, where marathon runners shared the streets with thousands of climate protesters yesterday.
In the bond markets, governments and development banks have been racing to surprise investors with innovative products and lure them into deals by brandishing their sustainability credentials.
The hottest new flavour is “sustainability-linked”. Chile and Uruguay are the only two governments to have tried this before, but it has huge potential to hand investors power to hold countries to account on their decarbonisation goals.
As I reported over the weekend, more governments are expected to issue this type of debt this year, particularly in emerging markets. Unlike almost any other financial instrument, it comes with clear built-in incentives to decarbonise: repayment costs increase when targets are missed and can fall when they are met.
Simon Zadek, chair of an initiative by the Swiss non-profit Nature Finance to build a set of norms around sustainability-linked sovereign debt, told Moral Money the logic behind climate and nature-linked debt is: “I’m going to make sure a tree doesn’t fall down, and when I prove it doesn’t you give me a reward.”
The attraction for governments is that they don’t have to ringfence cash raised for specific deals — an idea that underpins the $80bn in annual green bond issuances by governments, but which has always appeared dubious because of the essential fungibility of money.
See below for another wacky example of debt market innovation that borrows from the SLB idea but is its own thing altogether: Vietnam and the World Bank’s carbon-offset linked bond.

After my look at green steel in northern Sweden, I found myself on a rainy afternoon near Paris’s Jardin des Tuileries for the next leg of my journey through Europe’s emerging hydrogen economy. In an elegant building on the ancient Rue de Richelieu is the office of Hy24, which has just raised one of the world’s biggest hydrogen-focused funds — and is now starting to put its money to work.
Pierre-Étienne Franc set up Hy24 after more than two decades at French industrial gases company Air Liquide, the latter part of which was spent focusing on its hydrogen operation. During that time he became aware of a “chicken and egg problem” dogging the nascent clean hydrogen space. Potential customers of proposed green hydrogen projects were unwilling to commit until they saw evidence of strong support from investors — who were, in turn, nervous about customer demand.
Hy24 — a joint venture between investment groups Ardian and FiveT — is aiming to tackle that problem with its €2bn Clean Hydrogen Infrastructure fund, which it closed in October. It raised the cash from a large and diverse mix of investors — including industrial and energy companies such as TotalEnergies, Baker Hughes and Airbus, alongside financial groups like Axa, Allianz and CDPQ. Franc predicts the credibility of these backers will draw other investors and customers to each business that Hy24 invests in, ending the stasis that has been holding these projects back.
The fund has so far deployed about a tenth of its war chest in four businesses. One, a joint venture with Denmark’s Everfuel, is making green hydrogen (using renewable energy) for industrial use in Scandinavia. Another, Spain’s Enegás Renovable, plans to develop a national hydrogen pipeline network. Then there are two German companies: Hy2gen, which makes synthetic fuels using green hydrogen; and H2 Mobility, which is rolling out filling stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
The geographical spread speaks to the gathering momentum in this space across Europe. But there are challenges — not least Joe Biden’s $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, with its lavish support for hydrogen projects, which has already started sucking investment across the Atlantic.
Franc said the EU’s response — including plans for a new European Hydrogen Bank — was welcome, but far from sufficient to level the playing field, with European countries still restricted in the support they can give to domestic industry. The EU must now “once and for all” either give member states the right to spend big on hydrogen subsidies, Franc said, or deploy serious firepower through the European Commission. “We cannot be in between,” he added.
Hydrogen policy, he argued, could become a “source of European unity” — with countries bound together by a continental energy system using electricity and green hydrogen produced using renewable power from across Europe, as well as sun-drenched north Africa. “But Europe needs to take it very seriously,” he said. “Because if not, we will lose many energy-intensive industries.” (Simon Mundy)
How can a water purifier turn into a carbon credit, and how can this in turn become a coupon payment? This $50mn sleight of hand by the World Bank is expected to start yielding returns for investors next March.
It is the latest in a series of experimental attempts to create environmental and social impact through the bond market by blending capital from development banks and the private sector.
Mobilising private capital was a “priority theme” at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings earlier this month, including the use of innovative “outcome” bonds that incentivise companies or states to reach certain climate goals.
The World Bank issued bonds in February whose proceeds would provide a water purification project with roughly $7mn in investment — the amount the bank would normally have paid investors in coupon payments.
Intraco Carbon, a Ha Noi-based carbon offset developer, said it would use the money to deliver hundreds of thousands of water purifiers to Vietnamese schools, via the government.
Clean water is often obtained in Vietnam by burning biomass, which means the electric purifiers could avoid 3mn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over five years.
If the Vietnamese project hits its target for issuing carbon credits, and these are validated by verification body Verra, it will sell some of these credits to pay investors the amount they would have received as a coupon.
The experiment does not fit neatly into either of two usual deal structures for climate-focused bonds. Green bonds are used to raise cash ringfenced for sustainable projects, while sustainability-linked bonds raise general purpose funds but penalise issuers for failing to meet climate targets.
Tony Trzcinka, a senior portfolio manager at New Hampshire-based Impax Asset Management, bought $5mn worth of carbon-reduction linked bonds for the group’s core bond fund. “It’s unique, and it’s scaleable . . . There is clear additionality; this is not something they would be doing anyway,” he told Moral Money. Denmark’s Veliv Pension and US asset manager Nuveen also invested.
In the best-case scenario, the rate of coupon payments will hit about 1 per cent, which Trzcinka said was about four times the amount he would expect from a World Bank bond. And he still gets the benefit of exposure to triple-A-rated and highly liquid debt.
Vietnamese banks lag behind neighbouring countries when it comes to participating in green finance deals, according to a report by McKinsey last summer.
But the country could be a fertile space for unconventional green finance experiments. Agriculture and forestry projects and climate change or pollution programmes can already get preferential access to funding from the state bank.
And the country is about to receive a flood of cash, after agreeing to shift to renewable energy and cap overall power sector emissions at the end of last year in exchange for a $15.5bn funding package from international investors. (Kenza Bryan)
Hiro Mizuno was one of the greatest proponents of ESG as a driver for long-term investing during his time as head of Japan’s GPIF. Speaking remotely on Friday to a CFA Institute conference, Mizuno said it might be time to split social criteria from ESG.
At GPIF, Mizuno said he was determined not to allow people to split up ESG. But now Mizuno says he has changed his mind.
“When it comes to ‘S’, I always found it is almost impossible to agree because S by definition reflects some social value or some value judgment of society,” he said.
“The S of ESG is always the weakest link because it reflects the social value of the community,” and S “is actually attracting the attack on ESG as a whole”, he added.
Mizuno is not up for re-election to Tesla’s board, and it has nothing to do with a disagreement with Elon Musk over ESG, he said. Tesla was treated unfairly by S&amp;P when the carmaker was dropped from its flagship ESG index, Mizuno said.
“Tesla’s positive impact on the auto industry to move towards electric vehicles has never been valued in ESG scores,” he added. (Patrick Temple-West)

"Investors defy Goldman, Wells Fargo and BofA in vote for climate plans",ESG investing,"A rising tide of investors have backed demands for climate change plans from Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Bank of America this week, as lenders face continued pressures over the role they play in financing global warming.
Three in 10 of voting shareholders, including some of the world’s biggest investors, backed the resolution on Wednesday for Goldman to set out a climate risk transition plan that describes how it is aligning its financing activities with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emission. This was despite the board’s recommendation that investors vote against the proposal.
Wells Fargo disclosed on Thursday that almost 31 per cent of shareholders also voted for a transition plan resolution at the annual meeting on Wednesday.
Similarly, at Bank of America, preliminary figures showed 28.5 per cent of shareholders who voted backed an equivalent resolution, also against the board’s recommendation.
Significant shareholder dissent is generally regarded as being a vote against a management recommendation by at least 20 per cent of the shares voted.
The level of support for the resolutions is a sign of the increasing demands on banks over their financing of carbon-intensive companies and projects.
Norway’s oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, backed the transition plan resolutions at Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, as did Legal and General Investment Management.
The UK’s largest asset manager, LGIM, said it would also support the transition plan resolutions for JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley at forthcoming shareholder meetings.
Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential proxy adviser used by large investors to guide voting decisions at annual meetings, had recommended shareholders back the transition plan resolutions this week. It has yet to issue its advice for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.
In its proxy filing, Bank of America said it was “committed to achieving net zero emissions” from its “operations, supply chain and financing activities before 2050”, and was “transparent” about its progress.
The bank added that it has set and disclosed 2030 targets for reducing emissions associated with financing activities related to vehicle manufacturing, energy and power generation, and would commit to set and disclose financing activity emission reduction targets “for other key high-emitting sectors” by April 2024.
Goldman Sachs said the transition “to a more sustainable economy will be a decades-long effort requiring significant innovation and investment across the entire economy”.
“The role of Goldman Sachs is to help our clients unlock the enormous opportunities ahead as they navigate through the complexity of this transition,” it said.
Despite the votes falling short of majority backing, Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, which filed the resolutions at the US banks, said the group was “glad to see such a strong showing of support from shareholders”.
However, additional environmental, social and governance (ESG) resolutions put to the bank investors generally received a lower level of investor support.
A separate resolution focused on indigenous rights at Citigroup, which led to a war of words between the bank and an order of nuns over the financing of a company involved in oil pipelines, received support of about 31 per cent, but this was down slightly on a similar resolution last year.
Speaking about the proposal at the bank’s annual meeting John Dugan, Citi’s chair, said: “We are committed to respecting human rights wherever we do business.”
The votes on ESG issues this week came against the backdrop of pressures on asset managers themselves in the US over their role in so-called woke capitalism.
Some pension funds and Republican states, led by Florida governor Ron DeSantis, have driven a backlash against the consideration of environmental, social and governance issues in investment decisions.
Reflecting the sharply opposing views on the subject Daniel Firger, the US-based founder of Great Circle Capital Advisors, a consultancy focused on net zero investment strategies, presented the counter-attack.
“Investors would do well . . . try to tune out the kooky, culture war rhetoric coming from a small cadre of rightwing, fossil fuel-funded political operatives masquerading as corporate governance do-gooders,” he said.
According to Insightia, which tracks AGM voting, in the past only seven climate or environmental resolutions globally that were not backed by management have had the support of at least 28 per cent of shares voted.
Only one such resolution has ever received more than 50 per cent backing at a bank without support from management, the data shows. In 2019, just over half of shareholders backed a resolution calling for South Africa’s Standard Bank Group to adopt and disclose a policy on lending to coal-fired power projects and coal mining operations.
In 2020, 49.6 per cent of shareholders backed a resolution calling for JPMorgan to report on whether it was aligning its lending with the Paris agreement goal to keep global warming below 2C, and ideally below 1.5C.&nbsp;
The world’s 60 largest banks provided $673bn in financing for fossil fuels last year, according to data collated by a coalition of campaign groups, organised by the non-profit Rainforest Action Network.
JPMorgan was the world’s second-biggest lender to fossil fuels in 2022, the report shows, followed by Wells Fargo and Bank of America.
Beau O’Sullivan, a strategist at campaigning group Bank on our Future, said the pressure on banks over their financing of climate change “is not going away, for sure.”
“You will see this accelerate now. What we see in these transition plans is key,” he said.

Welcome back. As excitement — and trepidation — about huge advances in artificial intelligence have gathered in recent months, so has the debate about what a responsible business approach to AI should look like. Can we trust companies to act ethically with this rapidly evolving technology — or do we need governments to constrain them as swiftly as possible?
Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, was grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday, and issued a striking call for new regulation.
“We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” Altman said, suggesting a combination of licensing and testing requirements. “If this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” he added. “We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”
This is set to become a new hornets’ nest for responsible investors to grapple with — as if they didn’t already have enough to worry about.
In today’s edition, I look at another area of technology that’s increasingly in the spotlight, as companies rush to shore up their water supplies. And Kaori looks at how investors are helping to tackle the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Thanks for reading. (Simon Mundy)
Investor interest in water technology has been on the rise of late, as concern mounts about widespread shortages and contamination. But richly valued start-ups in the space have been thin on the ground.
So the latest fundraising from Boston-based company Gradiant, which has developed new ways to treat industrial wastewater, is worth noting. Today it announced a $225mn funding round, which values the company at $1bn — making it the water tech sector’s first “unicorn”. The round was led by New York family office BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital, the investment vehicle of Enron trader turned hedge fund manager John Arnold.
Gradiant’s bumper cash injection chimes with a new report from analysts at Jefferies, arguing that “now is the time” for investors to look at companies working to provide clean water.
For one thing, they note, companies are getting increasingly nervous about water supply, as climate change worsens. Government policy is starting to offer attractive financial incentives in this space — see, for example, the investment credits offered for certain types of wastewater treatment in Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. And businesses with a poor record on water pollution are at growing risk of punishment from regulators (witness the investigation into large UK water companies).
Gradiant chief executive Anurag Bajpayee told me the company was targeting the top levels of the water pollution “pyramid”. The lower levels of that pyramid have contaminants such as sewage — high-volume, but relatively easy to tackle. At the upper levels are industrial toxins that are released in smaller quantities —&nbsp;but can prove highly dangerous.
The company’s work builds on the postgraduate work Bajpayee undertook at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with his co-founder Prakash Govindan, with two key concepts behind Gradiant’s 250 patents. One aims at replicating the natural process through which water is purified and recycled, through evaporation and condensation. The second forces salty brines through a succession of membranes with increasingly high salinity.
Gradiant promises customers that its technology will allow them to purify and reuse larger amounts of water, reducing the amount they need to source externally. That has attracted customers from a range of industries, including chipmakers such as TSMC and Micron; miners BHP and Rio Tinto; and carmakers Hyundai and BMW.
The wide-ranging interest is partly a reflection of the growing pressure on companies — from society as well as regulators — to take a responsible approach to their water consumption and avoid pollution, said Bajpayee. But it also reflects an increasingly real concern about their own long-term water security. “If you can treat your wastewater as an opportunity,” he told me, “to a great degree you control your source of water.” (Simon Mundy)
In the past few weeks, the World Health Organization as well as the US government declared an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.
But as one health crisis ends, there’s already another on the horizon: the looming threat of antimicrobial resistance. And as we’ve discussed before, investors are taking notice.
So far, emphasis has mostly centred on the demand side of the antimicrobial value chain, such as large meat producers that are allegedly overusing existing antibiotics and thereby stoking antimicrobial resistance. But pharmaceutical companies are now cautiously betting on start-ups that are developing technology to battle this threat.
The AMR Action Fund, a public-private partnership supported by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations, will invest $1bn in start-ups with the aim of developing two to four new antibiotics by 2030 that target drug-resistant bacteria. In late April, the fund invested in two start-ups, Vedanta Biosciences and Pattern Bioscience, bringing the total to five. The fund’s investments are on track to reach a total of $200mn by the end of this year.
Antimicrobial resistance “is a silent pandemic”, Thomas Cueni, director-general of IFPMA, told me. There are “already 1.4mn people per year dying directly from antimicrobial resistance”, he says. But “big pharma quit [investing in antibiotics] because there are no sustainable markets”, he said.
A 2017 study showed that the cost to develop a new antibiotic was about $1.5bn. Meanwhile, a study by Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy showed that only five out of 16 new antibiotics approved between 2000 and 2017 generated annual sales of more than $100mn.
Even companies that have successfully developed new antibiotics that targeted drug-resistant bacteria have been forced out of business. Of the 12 antibacterial companies that went public in the past decade, only five have survived, according to a report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization.
This has spooked investors and pharmaceutical companies from getting into the development of new antibiotics, which in turn makes us more and more vulnerable to drug-resistant bacteria.
Until now, pharmaceutical companies “have gotten off the hook”, Sara Murphy, chief strategy officer at non-profit group The Shareholder Commons, told me. Eventually, she said, investor campaigns would need to extend to the pharmaceutical industry as well. Future campaigns could request companies to publish data on antimicrobial resistance, or ask to decouple the base pay and bonuses of sales agents from the volume of antimicrobials they sell.
On the demand side, investors are intensifying their campaigns. In the 2023 proxy season, the Shareholder Commons, together with asset managers Amundi and LGIM, as well as Hesta, one of Australia’s largest pension funds, filed shareholder proposals at McDonald’s, Tyson Foods, and Hormel Foods on antimicrobial resistance.
“As a diversified investor or universal owner, antimicrobial resistance will have an impact on multiple of the sectors in which we are shareholders,” said Maria Larsson Ortino, a senior global ESG manager at LGIM.
The proposals, which ask these companies to adhere to WHO guidelines on reducing antibiotic use, have so far secured 20.4 per cent of non-insider support at Tyson and 13.3 per cent at Hormel. The vote at McDonald’s is scheduled for May 25. If interest continues to grow, that may put the focus more on the pharmaceutical industry to engage.
Covid-19 “showed us the cost of an untreatable disease”, says Murphy, arguing that the next global health crisis could well be driven by a drug-resistant pathogen. The coronavirus pandemic “was absolutely predictable and it was just a matter of time. I think the same applies [to antimicrobial resistance]”. (Kaori Yoshida, Nikkei)

France’s TotalEnergies this week made “a clean exit” from Canadian oil sands with a $4bn sale of its assets there to Suncor, Canada’s second-largest oil company. It marks the latest divestment by European energy companies from Canada’s oil, which is often associated with higher levels of pollution than conventional production. BP also quit Canada’s oil sands industry last year. US companies have been far less willing to part ways with oil assets for environmental reasons.
This echoes the trend among US and European banks. European lenders, notably HSBC, are shifting away from fossil fuel projects. US banks have not, and continue to face fire from environmentalists for energy dealmaking at annual meetings.
There’s more on this theme below in my report about this week’s climate shareholder proposals at four of the biggest US banks.
And I also have news from the impact investing world, where it is getting harder to be best-in-class. — Patrick Temple-West
As pressure mounts to meet global net zero goals, carbon markets are in the spotlight. Approaches vary from cap-and-trade compliance schemes to voluntary carbon markets and internal carbon pricing. Meanwhile, some argue that to reduce emissions at sufficient scale and speed, carbon taxes are essential. The next FT Moral Money Forum report will explore the options and review the opportunities. And we want to hear from you.&nbsp;Do you favour carbon taxes? Can voluntary markets overcome quality concerns? Will compliance markets do more to push business to decarbonise? Share your thoughts here.
Shareholders at Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs this week voted on petitions asking the banks to phase out financing of new fossil fuel projects. These proposals didn’t fare well last year — and support for them this year was even lower.
Fewer than 10 per cent of shareholders supported these resolutions, the banks said. Last year 11-12 per cent of shareholders endorsed the phaseout demands.
“Investors have once again failed to align their voting with their stated positions on climate-related financial risk,” said Jessye Waxman, a senior campaigner at the Sierra Club. Investors “must move beyond calls for disclosure only” on climate issues at banks’ annual meetings, she added.
But shareholder proposals asking banks to disclose more about their climate policies actually fared better with investors. A first-time shareholder proposal at Goldman Sachs asked the bank to provide a realistic climate transition plan for 2030, and it won support from 30 per cent of the firms’ shareholders. The vote followed with a similar proposal at Bank of America that won 28.5 per cent support. (See our colleagues’ story on these votes here).
“Although Goldman has committed to aligning key sectors of its financing portfolio with net zero targets, its plan for achieving those goals is unclear,”&nbsp;said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, the advocacy group that filed the petitions.
“This strong vote is a call to action,” she said. “Goldman Sachs has demonstrated leadership in setting 2030 targets aligned with global climate goals. Now comes the hard work of making its plan actionable,” she said.
Environmental activists seem to be at an impasse. On the one hand, they could demand banks phase out fossil fuel projects and garner about 10 per cent support — not quite enough to rattle companies into changing behaviour. Or activists could demand disclosures and transition plans, which appear to be favoured by investors. The first approach conceivably reaps climate action more quickly — but only if more shareholders throw their weight behind it.
Amid the political attacks on ESG in the US, “asset managers — more than ever — do not wish to be perceived to be telling company management how to do their jobs,” Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar’s director of investment stewardship research, told me. “They want disclosure around climate strategy, but don’t want to set that strategy.”
The situation is quite different on the other side of the Atlantic, where, as mentioned above, institutions have shown more action on decarbonisation drives. But it’s a bit like comparing apples and oranges.
“It’s hard to conclude that shareholder action on climate is disadvantaging US banks compared with their international peers,” he said. “That pressure is manifesting in a different way on the other side of the Atlantic.”
Next month, the last two of the six major US banks will hold their annual meetings — JPMorgan on May 16 and Morgan Stanley on May 19 — and both face a similar suite of climate proposals as their peers. (Patrick Temple-West)
In the past few years, impact investing has evolved from a strategy for environmentalists into a growth opportunity for the world’s biggest banks. Speaking at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, then-UBS chief executive Ralph Hamers said “client interest in impact investing is rising significantly.”
But a chronic problem with impact reports is that they have been largely anecdotal. Impact reports from large financial firms tend to highlight a few investments in a school or clean energy project, but precise metrics are left out. For all the enthusiasm for impact investing, the data is sparse and only a handful of firms have been identified as leaders in the space.
Almost 200 firms have signed up for the impact investing principles set up by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation in 2019. These fund managers — which include Apollo, BlackRock and KKR — agreed to have their impact management practices* verified by independent assessors and update information annually.
According to BlueMark, a third-party verification firm, only six out of 60 firms sit atop its impact leaderboard: Bain Capital, British International Investment, Finance in Motion, Leapfrog, Nuveen and Trill.
To earn their spots on the leaderboard, these firms must identify* how much their investments are helping society. How significant is the intended impact? On the other hand, the firms must avoid ESG risks. Ultimately, firms must have impact objectives that are consistent and can actually be achieved.
You can read the BlueMark 2022 report for British International Investment here.
“Our goal with publishing the leaderboard was to create a race to the top,” Christina Leijonhufvud, BlueMark’s chief executive, told me.
Next month, BlueMark will be updating its leaderboard as four more names made the cut, she said. “We wanted to make sure this is not a check-the-box exercise. It will get harder to make it into that top quartile” of impact firms, she said.
As impact investing grows up, some big name investors are also eyeing opportunities within the businesses that do the ratings. Last week, BlueMark announced it had raised $10mn from S&amp;P Global, Temasek and other investors.
“We see significant growth opportunities for impact investing in Asia and around the world,” said Dawn Chan, a managing director at Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned investment fund. (Patrick Temple-West)

US investors ditch green funds as ‘woke capitalism’ backlash bites,ESG investing,"US investors’ enthusiasm for green investments has begun to wane in the face of repeated attacks on “woke capitalism” by Republicans, in a growing contrast to the billions still pouring into sustainable strategies in Europe.
Funds marketed with a sustainable label were hit with $12.4bn in net outflows in the US in the past 12 months even as green funds in Europe added $126.3bn, according to the data provider Morningstar.
The rift between the jurisdictions is a sign that the political backlash against asset managers who take a position on environmental, social and governance issues in the US have started to dampen appetite for ESG strategies, analysts say.
High-profile Republican figures including US Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Florida governor Ron DeSantis have in the past year campaigned against the use of investment strategies that penalise fossil fuel producers, arguing that such strategies have elevated environmental aims above asset managers’ primary responsibility of earning the best possible return on their clients’ investment.
“The absolute politicisation of ESG in the US is a huge driver” of the outflows, said Luke Sussams, ESG strategist at the US investment bank Jefferies, adding that the risk of repercussions against asset managers seen to be promoting green strategies is “very very real”.
“Even staunch advocates of sustainable finance are thinking the term is almost unusable. The broader trend is that capital has been drying up to US ESG products, which is very different to the trend we’re seeing in Europe.”
Flows into sustainable funds in the US have always been smaller than those in Europe, where asset managers have long trumpeted their ESG credentials as they seek to capitalise on enthusiasm for sustainable investing among investors, politicians and regulators.
But a steady trickle of cash has all but dried up since the second quarter of 2022, and more recently started to reverse. Although money is also flowing out of the broader universe of US investment funds, the ESG outflows have been larger relative to overall assets. In Europe, money continues to flow into sustainable investments faster than the funds sector as a whole.
Last month’s decision by BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, to remove the largest sustainable fund in the US from one of its popular portfolio allocation strategies has provided a further headwind. The switch drove $6.5bn of outflows from the fund between January and March, roughly a third of its overall assets, according to Morningstar.
The removal of the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF — which favours stocks with high ESG ratings and avoids investing in thermal coal or civilian firearms — from its strategy midway through March was driven by concerns that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could cause widespread shock throughout the financial system, according to a person familiar with BlackRock’s decision.
The ESG fund was largely replaced in its strategy by an iShares MSCI ETF focused on “quality” US stocks, which minimises exposure to companies with heavy debt burdens, but does not take sustainability into account. BlackRock declined to say whether it continues to recommend any ESG funds to investors who follow the strategy.
Sussams said BlackRock’s decision would likely have been taken with one eye on the rightwing backlash, not just the banking crisis.
BlackRock said: “As a fiduciary, we have an obligation to act in the best interest of our clients and to be solely focused on their investment objectives. Our clients’ interests come first. Always.”
Asset managers including BlackRock were added to a list of institutions seen as hostile to fossil fuels by Texas officials last year and have been hit with withdrawals from cash management products in Republican states.
In a public letter last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink sought to address the backlash against the firm’s policy of encouraging companies in which it holds a stake to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
In a shift in tone from his previously more strident embrace of ESG, Fink emphasised that clients were responsible for their own investment decisions.
“There are many people with opinions about how we should manage our clients’ money,” he wrote. “But the money doesn’t belong to these people. It’s not ours either. It belongs to our clients, and our responsibility and our duty is to them.”
Hortense Bioy, head of sustainability research at Morningstar, said that momentum for ESG investing in the US peaked in 2021 and at the start of last year before dropping off in the past 12 months.
Scepticism of ESG in the US may be growing as investors gain a “better understanding of sector biases”, she said. Green funds have traditionally favoured tech stocks, which tumbled last year, while avoiding the resurgent energy sector. However, the Republican party’s anti-ESG animus has undoubtedly played a role, according to Bioy.
“It’s hard to ignore the unfavourable political environment in the US,” she said."

How much should venture capitalists worry about ESG scores and net zero goals when deciding which start-ups to take a punt on?
Not much, according to Michael Liebreich, who founded Bloomberg’s New Energy finance research service and is an angel investor in more than a dozen clean-tech start-ups. These include low-carbon fertiliser business CCm Technologies and ChargePoint, which develops electric charging infrastructure in the US and Europe.
“What start-ups should be doing is looking for pinch points” like technology failings, the expense involved in electrifying heating systems, or the need for reliable nuclear reactors, Liebreich told Moral Money.&nbsp;
Tesla is an example of a successful idea that does not necessarily translate easily into an ESG score. The electric-car maker has an unofficial target of selling 20mn vehicles a year by 2030 but a patchy record on social issues and a high exposure to the mining sector. It was removed from the S&amp;P 500 ESG index last year after it faced racial discrimination allegations and fears around the safety of self-driving cars.
“I don’t know whether Elon Musk buys offsets when he travels, and he’s not a respectful employer from my perspective,” Liebreich said. “But clearly Tesla has moved the electrification of cars forward by decades. No accounting system will account for that.”
Today, Ivan Levingston, European deals reporter for the FT, writes about the latest VC to earn B-corp certification. And in a higher interest rate world, I ask what role venture capital can play in making sure climate start-ups get a reasonable shot at lift-off. (Kenza Bryan)
The B Corp movement has been under scrutiny of late, with critics arguing the certification initiative has been letting its standards slip as it seeks to sign up big-name new members.
But it is still seeing fresh demand for its responsible business label from the venture capital industry.
Felix Capital is the latest VC firm to become a B Corp, as funds jostle to differentiate themselves amid a growing emphasis on sustainability across the technology ecosystem.Founded in 2015, London-based Felix manages $1.2bn of assets and has backed prominent start-ups including the food delivery service Deliveroo and oat drink company Oatly.It joins about 6,400 companies worldwide with B Corp certification, which requires them to pass an assessment of their sustainability credentials. They also need to make a legally binding commitment to pursue positive social and environmental impact.Felix’s founder and managing partner Frederic Court sees the programme as a way to advance his firm’s values even while performance remains the priority.“It’s the right way to be in business,” Court told me. “It’s not a religion; we don’t have to be dogmatic about it, but it means that everything we do, we have to think about how it impacts our status as a B Corp.”Felix has shifted the way it operates, from altering its own partnership agreement to changing the term sheets it gives entrepreneurs in offering investment, which now come with language around diversity and sustainability. Those changes have been welcomed by entrepreneurs. “There was zero pushback from founders. They totally embrace it,” Court said.Felix has donated 1 per cent of carried interest — the profits generated by investment firms — from its third fund to a water charity. It’s also investing in companies such as Effy, a French business that helps people renovate their homes to increase energy efficiency. Felix chose to pursue B Corp certification over other options like rebranding itself as an impact fund — even though that might have made it easier to raise funds, Court said. “We don’t want to take money from investors by ticking boxes,” he said.Other VCs that have become B Corps include Obvious Ventures, MMC Ventures and real estate technology investor Fifth Wall, according to the website of B Lab, the non-profit group that runs the certification programme. “It’s easy to criticise,” Court said, pushing back against the notion that B Corp status is easy to attain. “It’s already harder . . . especially for smaller companies.” (Ivan Levingston).
The decision by the world’s biggest climate finance grouping to launch a venture capital arm is the latest sign of the pressure that VCs face to shield their investors from risks around the energy transition.
Smaller energy-focused funds like Energy Impact Partners signed up to Mark Carney’s Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero last month, as did bigger investors with a broad tech focus such as New York-based Tiger Global.
But the launch came in the wake of the exit of three major insurers from Gfanz’s Net Zero Insurance Alliance, prompted by fears of a possible backlash against climate collaboration by competition authorities (a risk that has been hammed up by anti-ESG Republican politicians in the US).
The recent headwinds for Gfanz are worth keeping in mind when considering its baby-step approach for its 23 new VC members. They must “encourage and assist” portfolio companies to set net zero carbon emission goals — but can keep investing in potential high emitters while remaining part of the group.&nbsp;
Unlike the banking, insurance and asset management worlds, venture capital does not yet have an established framework for measuring carbon emissions. One of the dilemmas is whether to look at the potential emissions of a start-up over its whole lifetime, as opposed to in its first growth years. As Michael Liebreich highlighted, carbon is not necessarily the best metric for assessing a start-up’s potential to change the world.&nbsp;
Rather than setting a strict decarbonisation goal, the point of Gfanz’s new grouping is to develop ESG tools appropriate to early-stage investments. “Our goal is to bridge the gap between what’s happening in public markets . . . and early-stage innovation,” said Alexandra Harbour, founder and chair of the new group and a principal at San Francisco-based Prelude Ventures.
Market forces are already pushing more VCs towards climate-friendly investments, particularly because the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan are bringing increasing tailwinds to the space.
Investments in climate tech were resilient to the broader market downturn in VC dealmaking between January and March, according to data provider PitchBook.
Climate-focused Congruent Ventures closed a $300mn fund last month on the back of what it said was growing interest from institutional investors in later stage climate start-ups.

US Republicans this week took significant action against environmental, social and governance investing. Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a sweeping anti-ESG bill that bans the state from issuing green or ESG bonds. The law also stops state pension funds from considering ESG criteria when voting at companies’ annual meetings.
Unlike in other states, where banking lobbyists have successfully watered down anti-ESG bills, the Florida law was enacted as originally proposed.
In Oklahoma, the state treasurer published a list of 13 financial firms deemed to be boycotting the energy industry, including JPMorgan, one of the largest fossil fuel financiers. BlackRock, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and State Street were also excluded from doing business with the state, Oklahoma said.
In an interview with our colleague Aime Williams, Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt said ESG companies are welcome in the state. But “for the shareholder return, we’re not going to allow [pensions] funds to be invested for someone’s political agenda,” he said. (Stay tuned for Aime’s full interview with the governor in the days ahead).

The next FT Moral Money Forum report will dig deep into carbon markets, and we want to hear from you. Do you favour carbon taxes? Can voluntary markets overcome quality concerns? Will compliance markets do more to push business to decarbonise? Share your thoughts here.
Warren Buffett’s nickname is the Oracle of Omaha, and there certainly is a religious fervour surrounding him at his company’s annual meetings each year. Shareholders come to pay homage to his investing abilities, but there is also reverence for his frugality and his promise to give most of his fortune to charity.
He seems like the type of ego-lite billionaire who would fit well with the environmentalist crowd. So why doesn’t Buffett seem to care about climate change?
Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, holds its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. It is typically a big party. But this year, Buffett and his team are under mounting pressure to address climate concerns.&nbsp;
Norway’s oil fund, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, said this week it won’t support the re-election of any of Berkshire Hathaway’s board directors this year, in part because the company has failed to make climate risk disclosures.
Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors vote against the company’s lead independent director Susan Decker over climate accountability. “The company is a significant greenhouse gas emitter and is not taking the minimum steps needed to understand, assess, and mitigate risks related to climate change,” ISS said.
The California Public Employees’ Retirement System and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec have also filed a petition that is up for a vote tomorrow, demanding Berkshire publish a climate report.
Last year, BlackRock and Vanguard both voted for shareholder proposals at Berkshire Hathaway on climate disclosures as well as emissions reductions targets. Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t have adequate climate risk disclosures against all four pillars of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), BlackRock said.
Buffett controls more than 30 per cent of the votes at Berkshire Hathaway, making it almost impossible for outside shareholders to change things.&nbsp;Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Buffett’s legacy as an investing sage is indisputable, as is his humility and good humour. But for some reason, he is being intransigent on climate. TCFD disclosures have become a bare minimum in the US. Why has Buffett shrugged off climate concerns — if only to serve as an example to the rest of corporate America?
At some point, Buffett’s climate stance might start to taint his reputation. Saturday’s shareholder meeting is likely to serve up some evidence. (Patrick Temple-West)
Paul Cowley’s memoir Thief Prisoner Soldier Priest recounts a life that took him from crime and homelessness to prison, and then from the British army to a priesthood in the Church of England. Now he has embarked on a new chapter — hiring people with criminal convictions to work for one of the UK’s largest supermarket chains.
Cowley’s unusual title — director of rehabilitation — reflects an approach that sets Iceland Foods apart from its peers in UK business.
Most big companies have made progress on providing opportunities for people who have been historically disadvantaged by their gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. Few, however, have taken a similar approach to people with criminal records — who are often required to declare this at the outset of a hiring process, and then swiftly ruled out of consideration.
Many employers may not realise what a large demographic group this is: 27 per cent of working-age UK adults have a criminal conviction, mostly for relatively minor offences that led to a short prison sentence or none at all. In the US, about a third have a record of criminal conviction or arrest. At a time of acute labour shortages — Iceland Foods is currently advertising nearly 650 vacancies on its website — companies could profit by making smarter use of this section of the workforce.
Since taking on his corporate role in September, Cowley has interviewed 130 prison inmates nearing the end of their sentences, and given jobs to about 70. Of those, about half remain Iceland employees. The other half have dropped out — some failing drug tests, others not turning up for work — a setback that was to be expected, said Cowley, who worked extensively with ex-offenders during his time in the Church. “You know, prison affects people,” he told me.
Since joining Iceland’s board at the invitation of its founder Sir Malcolm Walker, Cowley has been working to overhaul its recruitment process. Applicants for jobs on the company’s website are now informed that it is actively seeking to hire more people with criminal convictions — a stark contrast with other companies’ practice of quiet exclusion.
Iceland may be an outlier in the UK, but companies have been much more active on this front across the Atlantic. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon boasted last year that 10 per cent of the bank’s hires in 2021 had criminal records, and that (in contrast with Cowley’s experience so far) “retention rates for this population are very high”.
Companies including Walmart, Target and Home Depot don’t ask for details of criminal records until the later stages of the hiring process, giving applicants a better chance to impress their potential employers. Major corporations such as Microsoft and Verizon have lent their support to campaigns in various US states for legislative reforms to erase old convictions from individuals’ records.
In the UK, the FairChecks campaign is calling for reforms that would give adults a clean slate for childhood offences, and — after a certain period — for offences that resulted in a short prison sentence. Its backers include Lord Michael Hastings, a longtime advocate for smarter approaches to crime reduction. “We mouth these phrases of diversity, equity, inclusion — but when it comes to this section of people, all that goes out of the window,” he told me. “This is a resource of people that the economy needs.”
But businesses should seize the initiative rather than putting the focus on legislative change, said Ashish Prashar, who served a sentence for theft before a career that has included working for former prime minister Tony Blair and later as an advertising executive. “You don’t need to wait for government to pass laws,” he told me, “to give people a second chance, to fill vacancies, to move the economy forward.” (Simon Mundy)

How to add wings to your tracker portfolio,ETF Hub,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Despite many seeing them as the ideal hunting ground for stockpickers, falling markets have done little to dent UK appetite for passive funds in the past year. Trackers took in nearly £10bn in net retail sales in 2022, meaning they now represent&nbsp;some 21&nbsp;per cent of the industry assets monitored by the Investment Association.
This popularity, built during the previous decade, is understandable when you consider the good returns passives have delivered for much of that time. They also tend to offer a decent level of diversification in many cases. Having said that, some of the most widely owned trackers offer skewed exposure to their underlying markets, given their particular&nbsp;focus on the winning names and the fact that certain segments are left sorely under-represented. So filling some of these gaps with other funds, both active and passive, can help add an edge to your portfolio.
Popular as MSCI World trackers are, it is fair to accuse them of in effect being a play on the US, which made up 68 per cent&nbsp;of the index at the end of March. The S&amp;P 500 and the global benchmark, in turn, serve as a play on Big Tech. Apple made up 4.9 per cent of the MSCI World index at the end of March, with&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;on 3.8 per cent,&nbsp;Alphabet on 2.4 per cent,&nbsp;Amazon on 1.8 per cent and&nbsp;Meta Platforms on 0.9 per cent. That presence rises even further in an S&amp;P 500 tracker, with Apple alone making up 7.1 per cent of the&nbsp;Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Ucits ETF (VUSA)&nbsp;at the end of March.
That reminds us of the need for diversification in two different respects. First, it can make sense to simply bulk up on other exposure to regions outside of the US, be that Asia, the emerging markets, Japan, Europe or the UK. Trackers are one simple way to do this, and names we outlined in last year’s Top 50 ETFs list include&nbsp;the&nbsp;iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF (EMIM), the&nbsp;Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe ex UK UCITS ETF (VERX)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;iShares Core MSCI Japan IMI UCITS ETF (SJPA).
This article was previously published by Investors Chronicle, a title owned by the FT Group.
In terms of US allocations,&nbsp;investors might want diversification beyond the tech majors and more exposure to the “real” economy. Premier&nbsp;Miton US Opportunities takes a bottom-up stockpicking approach and hunts further down the market cap spectrum. The fund has returned roughly the same as the S&amp;P 500 over a five-year stretch, albeit with some notable differences in performance at times, including in 2022 when the fund was down 4.4 per cent versus a 9.3 per cent fall in the S&amp;P 500.
Another way to diversify exposures on both the global front and in the US can be via income funds, which will look past most of the US tech majors with the exception of Microsoft. In the US,&nbsp;JPM US Equity Income lists names such as&nbsp;ExxonMobil among its top holdings and has a modest allocation to the information technology sector, with financials and healthcare as its biggest sector weightings.
As previously discussed, active global funds with less of a US focus do exist. Some examples include value portfolios such as&nbsp;Jupiter Global Value Equity and Schroder Global Recovery, while income funds such as&nbsp;Murray International also look&nbsp;past the US. Big generalist global investment trusts such as&nbsp;Alliance Trust&nbsp;have also tended to focus less closely on the US and the tech majors.
Some passives similarly have less of a US tilt, including&nbsp;the relatively UK-focused Vanguard LifeStrategy multi-asset range. But with any of these approaches, investors need to ask what bias they prefer and whether they want such a heavy focus on domestic shares.
UK trackers have not always served investors well, but recently some of that underperformance has been removed. The FTSE 100&nbsp;has performed well this year, with exposure to the likes of energy and some popular dividend payers working out well.
A problem here is that investors using FTSE 100 trackers miss out on exposure to small and mid-cap stocks, which have come under pressure in the past year but have fared relatively well over a longer period. As we recently discussed, names such as&nbsp;BlackRock Throgmorton could serve as a good play on small and mid-caps. Small-cap funds certainly look cheap at the minute following a fierce sell-off, even if they could&nbsp;face further problems as a recession looms.
Active UK equity funds broadly tend to have a decent&nbsp;focus on small and mid-cap shares, especially in the growth space. Even some of the largest and most successful names try to look beyond large caps:&nbsp;Liontrust Special Situations, for one, had a 43.4 per cent allocation to the FTSE 100 at the end of March, but has diversified across the market cap spectrum with 30.4 per cent in FTSE 250 stocks and 21.2 per cent in Aim. Man GLG Undervalued Assets, a popular name with more of a value bias, had a 40.8 per cent allocation to the FTSE 250 at the end of March.
The Asian market, like the US, is dominated by a few superstar names, with stocks such as TSMC and Chinese internet majors such as Tencent&nbsp;featuring prominently in both the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan index and MSCI Emerging Markets. That bias can be offset in different ways:&nbsp;funds such as&nbsp;Pacific Assets go a different way, namely by having a much more limited exposure to China. That, however, does leave them with big exposures elsewhere: Pacific Assets had 41.3 per cent of its portfolio in India at the end of March.
Europe has fewer such problems with Nestlé, the biggest name in the MSCI Europe ex UK index, making up 4.3 per cent of the index&nbsp;at the end of March. Some&nbsp;sector skews are still evident, but they are far from extreme: industrials, healthcare and financials each made up about 16 per cent of the index. And the average fund in the IA Europe ex UK sector tends to stay in line with some of these biases, with 17.3 per cent in industrials at the end of March according to FE data.

Thinking beyond public debt,EU economy,"Marcello Minenna is an economist serving as technical assessor for the Calabria region, adjunct professor of financial econometrics and empirical finance at the Università Telematica San Raffaele, and columnist at Il Sole 24 Ore. Opinions expressed are strictly personal.
Our readers largely know that Italy’s public debt burden is very high, both in absolute terms and in its debt-to-GDP ratio.
But this ignores a significant amount of the debt landscape: when private non-financial debt is included, Italy doesn’t seem nearly as burdened.
To set the stage, we should first take a look at how public debt has evolved over time in the EU.
For our purposes today we will compare the four largest eurozone economies — and Greece, with its historically high debt burden and recent signs of a turnround — using BIS data on the market value of private and public debt.
European countries’ debt-to-GDP ratios mostly rose between 2008 and 2022, with Germany serving as an exception:
As shown above, debt-to-GDP ratios have decreased since February 2021. This decline has been global, as documented by the IFF, and is attributable to a couple of different factors. First, there’s been an increase in GDP connected to the post-pandemic resumption of economic activities and international trade. Seconds, governments have relied less on debt issuance for funding since the end of the Covid-19 crisis.
And while the chart above shows that Italy’s public debt level remains high relative to its peers, there are other ways to evaluate a country’s indebtedness.
When private nonfinancial debt is taken into account, Italy’s debt levels stands at considerably lower levels than many of its major European counterparts. Families in Italy, for example, have a lower debt burden than any of our comparison countries:
Italy also stands out for its relatively low levels of indebtedness among non-bank corporations:
In fact, if we combine public debt and non-financial private sector debt and then compare them to GDP, Italy has the second-lowest debt burden of the group, right behind Germany:
That is something to take into consideration, since a high level of private debt might contribute to financial instability. This was the case for Iceland, where, just before the 2008 economic crisis, the private-debt-to-GDP ratio reached a ratio of 450 per cent.
The analogies do not end here, since that crisis hit hard when interest rates started to rise. (While Iceland’s financial sector was the source of its problems, the 2008-09 crisis showed that many governments aren’t willing to let their banks fail, giving them semi-public status.)
Yet even with its relatively low aggregate non-bank debt levels, Italy’s sovereign yields remain high. Italy’s average 10-year bond yield is the highest of the bunch, at 4.45 per cent to Greece’s 4.42 per cent:
One could argue that investors’ expectations are affected more by the EU’s regulatory supervision than by macroeconomic conditions.
From this perspective, Italy appears to be disadvantaged by a regulatory system that has far too sharp a focus on public debt-to-GDP ratios, while underestimating or ignoring other parameters. One potential useful parameter neglected by EU regulatory supervision is the non-financial private sector debt-to-GDP ratio. Eurostat’s monitor of macroeconomic imbalances prescribes that ratio remain below 133 per cent, while the comparable threshold for a country’s public-debt-to-GDP ratio is 60 per cent.
Another parameter ignored by EU regulatory supervision is the measure of trade balances. Germany, for its part, spent years with a trade surplus greater than the 6-per-cent regulatory threshold set by Eurostat, and its trade surplus hovered above or right around that level from 2012 until 2021:
One benefit of basing convergence rules on measurements of public debt is that EU member governments have direct control over their own borrowing. With private-debt monitoring, governments’ relationships with borrowers and investors are subject to market rules, only mediated through government economic-policy actions.
Nevertheless, it might be necessary to reconsider and supplement the standard measurements in the review of the convergence criteria expected in the next few months. That review will take into account the exogenous variables that have affected the EU in the recent past (eg, the pandemic, war) or will affect it in the near future (climate change, immigration flows) and their consequences on the real economy (ie, inflationary pressures, levels of employment, and a need for structural investments). Officials may want to consider private debt levels as well.
For example, we can expect that a low level of private-sector debt and/or a high level of private savings are likely to contribute to the system’s stability, and, therefore, such phenomena must be considered by public debt management regulations.
A recent study shows that, since 1950, only on one occasion a reduction of public debt went hand in hand with a reduction of private sector debt.
These findings might be explained considering that a higher private debt exposure might have boosted the economy, consequently increased tax revenue and reducing the automatic stabilisers expenditure ratio. Alternatively, the stronger fiscal discipline directed to reduce public debt might have drained resources from the private sector and pushed companies and families to a higher debt exposure.
In any case, data collected over the past 70 years shows that if the private sector does not increase its debt exposure, it is unlikely that EU countries will be able to achieve a significant reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
In Italy, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased since 2008. This continued until the end of the pandemic. In contrast, private debt data shows a slowing growth since July 2009, followed by a less than proportional decline that started at the end of 2012, except for a temporary surge during the pandemic:
Italian families’ total wealth (if we also consider real estate, net of liabilities) is over €10tn. During 2021, Italian families’ net wealth was the highest in Europe, at 8.7 times their disposable income (France: 8.6; Germany: 8.8).
Nevertheless, the Italian savings rate, which has been the highest in the developed world for a long time, has been falling for at least two decades. But there has been a trend reversal with the start of the pandemic:
This is not surprising. In a climate of uncertainty, individuals are less likely to consume, and more likely to allocate a part of their income to savings. That’s exactly what happened between January 2020 and September 2021, when families’ financial wealth increased by €334bn, with the greater part of it deposited in bank accounts.
In 2004, Italians saved about 15 per cent of their yearly income, an average savings rate only surpassed by Germany and Belgium and higher than the broader eurozone’s.&nbsp;
Today’s situation is quite different.&nbsp;It is estimated that Italian families save on average just 10 per cent of their yearly income, the lowest in Italian history, while the eurozone averages 14 per cent. There is a widening gap between the savings rates of Italian families and German families.
After the pandemic, both private debt and families’ savings rates increased in Italy: that’s a clear indicator of an increase in social inequalities. In other words, the poorest individuals and those who suffered a decrease in income took debt to maintain their standard of living, while, the richest individuals invested even more.
Italians’ ongoing impoverishment is confirmed by the results of a study conducted by the International Labour Organization, or ILO: at purchasing power parity (PPP), the Germans and the French receive higher salaries today than they did in 2008, while Italians’ salaries decreased by 12 per cent:
It is important to stay mindful of the challenges faced by Italy in its efforts to reduce the gap with the other Eurozone countries in terms of real income. The safest way to do that, and to strengthen the eurozone and EU in the process, is to review convergence policies that are far too focused on public debt alone."
"EU gas price cap would deliver $33bn blow to market, says ICE",EU energy,"Energy traders would have to stump up an additional $33bn in margin payments if a plan by Brussels to cap the price of a key European gas benchmark goes ahead, a leading exchanges operator has warned.
Producers and traders that rely on the Dutch TTF futures market face an 80 per cent rise in the payments they make as insurance to secure their deals, Intercontinental Exchange has told the European Commission, according to a memo seen by the Financial Times.
Such a large increase in margin requirements could “destabilise the market”, ICE, the Atlanta-based group that runs the TTF market, said in the memo. ICE declined to comment.
Margin requirements on swaps and futures used by energy producers have already doubled this year, according to the European Central Bank, forcing many companies to draw on credit lines with their banks and conduct more trades privately, where margin requirements are lower.
ICE’s warning comes as EU authorities race to finalise a planned ceiling on the region’s gas prices, which soared over the summer as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and scorching temperatures hit supplies, curbed economic output across the bloc and forced EU energy companies to seek billions of euros in emergency funds.
The 27 EU member states are trying to hammer out an agreement that can be implemented by the end of the year. The commission on Tuesday proposed to limit the price of the upcoming contract on the TTF market. TTF accounts for around four-fifths of gas trading in the bloc.
Brussels proposed capping the gas price if it hits €275 per megawatt hour for two consecutive weeks and if the difference between it and a benchmark for European liquefied natural gas costs is €58 per MWh or more for 10 days within those weeks. At those levels, the cap would not have been triggered even as gas prices spiked to unprecedented levels this summer, leading critics to question the usefulness of the curbs.
Diplomats from among the 15 EU countries that pushed for a cap — fearing another spike in gas prices this winter could set off social unrest and further strain public finances — have signalled that their governments would oppose it at such a high level.
But ICE warned that any kind of cap would mean the upcoming contract would include more risk and incorporate more private deals, which would force the exchange to ask customers for more money upfront. The risk was “instantaneous”, it said.The exchange’s $33bn estimate covered both initial margin, which protects counterparties against the risk of default, and variation margin, which covers fluctuating daily market prices.
A potential jump in margin demands would hit a market that is already under strain, as energy trading companies struggle to find the money to back their futures trades, widely used by energy producers and consumers to ensure supply and guarantee the price they will receive.
In September, Germany and other member states were forced to offer liquidity support to energy firms that were struggling with collateral demands.
The AFM, the Dutch regulator which oversees the TTF futures market, has also warned that a cap could halt trading temporarily and force more deals to be negotiated privately, away from the exchange.
The mechanism would be suspended within a day should it risk critical gas supplies being sent elsewhere, affect financial stability or prompt an increase in consumption, according to commission experts.
“We are aware that when you intervene in a derivatives market, there are implications [and] we have been discussing those implications with experts,” a senior EU official said.
The person added that the mechanism was being “calibrated to respond to those risks”, but also had “necessary safeguards . . . to ensure that if anything seriously does happen we have what is needed to respond and respond quickly”.
The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ICE memo."
Europe’s gas traders and exchanges warn of futures cap risks,EU energy,"Europe’s big gas traders and exchanges have warned that a proposal by Brussels to cap futures that help set prices in the EU will create “major risks” to the bloc’s financial stability and energy supplies.
According to a draft proposal, seen by the Financial Times, the European Commission is planning to set a cap for the most widely-used gas futures contract in an effort to calm markets and avoid a return to the “abnormal” prices of more than €300 per megawatt hour that the bloc briefly experienced in August — a price equivalent to more than $500 a barrel for oil.
EU officials want to reform the workings of Europe’s gas market, arguing that futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, had become detached from gas prices in other markets, particularly for liquefied natural gas being shipped into the bloc. TTF futures are based in the Netherlands and run by US group Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
But energy exchanges and traders have warned that a cap for the so-called “front month”, or upcoming month, of contracts would put a greater strain on the market as they try to sell their energy or hedge against risks in a more opaque over-the-counter market.The European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET) warned on Monday that “even a short intervention would have severe, unintended and irreversible consequences in harming market confidence that the value of gas is known and transparent”.
Unexpected and large margin calls in the over-the-counter market could strain traders and potentially force them into bankruptcy, it said, adding that the ability of exchanges to contain defaults would be “severely compromised.” Similar concerns have also been raised by ICE, according to memos seen by the FT.
Trading executives are particularly concerned by EU proposals to link a potential cap to more illiquid and volatile benchmarks that follow the price of LNG. TTF is based on market transactions and considered the benchmark for the global natural gas market.
A move to “over-the-counter” trades would “not only lead to a significant decrease in transparency but also poses serious financial stability risks”, said Christian Baer, secretary-general of Europex, the association of European energy exchanges, in a letter sent to the commission over the weekend.
EFET warned that, as a result, exchanges might have to suspend trading if they could “not meet obligations on running fair and orderly markets”. The European Central Bank last week warned against policies which could push more trading off exchange.
Baer also noted that interventions such as price caps needed to be “rigorously tested” to make sure that markets would not be put in jeopardy. “It is unrealistic to assume this can be achieved within a short timeframe and certainly not before the end of this winter.”
At a meeting of diplomats in Brussels on Friday, concerns were also raised that the cap would only be halted after any negative effects had been discovered. “Safeguards checks are only applied ex-post [so] how can compliance with the safeguards be ensured when the measure is in place?” one diplomat asked. “It is similar to installing airbags after you ran your car into an accident.”
Despite reservations among experts working in the commission, Brussels has been put under increasing pressure by more than half of the EU’s member states to propose a cap on gas prices to avoid the spiralling costs the bloc experienced during the summer when there was a rush to fill up gas storage units ahead of the colder months.
Gas prices remain high by historical standards but have fallen back substantially since August and now trade at around €118p/mwh.
Until the commission’s latest proposal was put forward, Greece, Italy, Poland and Belgium had all threatened to veto a wider set of measures due for approval by energy ministers on Thursday. These include joint gas purchasing and an emergency mechanism to share gas between countries in case of one being cut off unless a ceiling on gas prices was introduced.
Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, however, are opposed to a cap unless it meets strict safeguards such as not affecting flows of gas around the EU, not increasing consumption or threatening security of supply by making the EU uncompetitive on global markets.
The commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the draft.

Brussels demands share of London derivatives clearing,EU financial regulation,"The EU will demand that derivatives traders use accounts at clearing houses in the bloc for some of their transactions, as part of plans to take a share of the €115tn market processed through the City of London.
Banks dealing with large quantities of contracts that are deemed “systemic” by regulators would have to clear a minimum amount of business via active accounts in EU-based clearing houses, officials briefed on the proposals said.
The plans are part of a package intended to boost Europe’s capital markets and reduce the EU’s reliance on the UK’s financial services sector after Brexit. The European Commission is planning to outline the measures next month when it publishes proposals.
“It’s a very active policy in the EU to repatriate business back to the eurozone. They want to have control over where it is happening,” said Karel Lannoo, chief executive of European think-tank CEPS. “It’s a very serious issue for London.”
Most of the world’s interest rate swaps are processed in London, at clearing houses that have not moved since Brexit. Politicians in the EU are unhappy that euro-denominated derivatives are handled in a market outside their regulators’ direct oversight.The draft rules aim to address what the EU sees as a “strategic vulnerability”, a senior commission official said. “It’s not about shifting all your business from London to the EU and never doing business with the City of London again. It’s about diversifying.”
The requirements under consideration would apply to derivatives, and could include credit swaps and futures.
The detailed thresholds under the new clearing regime would be set at a later stage, but one option is for the EU to demand progressive increases in the volumes required to go through EU-based clearing houses, the officials said.
To make it more attractive for investors to use EU clearing houses, the commission will also accelerate plans for authorising new derivatives products, responding to industry complaints that EU regulatory approvals are too slow compared with the UK. It will also step up dialogue between national clearing house supervisors, while enhancing the central role of the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority.
Britain’s control of the market has assumed a fresh urgency because from next summer EU pension funds, which hold investments for thousands of EU citizens, will also be required to clear their derivatives trades.
The commission this year agreed to extend its temporary permit allowing European banks and fund managers to use UK clearing houses until June 2025, warding off a threat to financial market stability when the arrangement was set to lapse at the end of June.
Mairead McGuinness, European commissioner for financial services, said the move would avoid any “short-term cliff-edge effects”.&nbsp;
But the commission has also vowed to stop issuing temporary extensions to its “equivalence” arrangement with the UK. Pushing more derivatives into clearing in Europe would potentially benefit Germany’s Deutsche Börse and Euronext, the Amsterdam-listed group that owns many of the eurozone’s stock exchanges.
“We would like to send a very strong signal to the markets that we are serious — and we will,” said the senior commission official, while adding that the rules would be carefully calibrated to ensure markets are not destabilised.
The commission is now working on draft amendments to the EU’s European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which will be tabled in early December, with a view to bolstering the EU’s market share of derivatives clearing.
The proposals come alongside two further sets of initiatives that the commission hopes will also boost its flagging Capital Markets Union project. These are reforms firstly to make it easier for small and medium-sized companies to tap public markets, including by permitting simplified prospectuses.
Secondly, the proposals would aim to better harmonise national insolvency rules. Among the ideas are simplified procedures for very small companies and a requirement that member states introduce so-called prepack regimes permitting the sale of some or all of a business before it enters insolvency."
EU faces last-ditch challenge from exchanges over trading reforms,EU financial regulation,"European reforms to make the region’s markets more competitive with the US face a last-ditch opposition from stock exchanges reluctant to hand over their data to a planned real-time database of share trading information.
European Union officials on Tuesday will begin negotiations to lay out the framework for live records of stock and bond trading information, a move that supporters say would vastly improve transparency and entice big foreign investors to trade in European stock markets.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, hopes the measures will help unify its fragmented market and make it more comparable to the US, whose stock markets are more dynamic and twice as valuable.
European markets also have suffered a dearth of listings, with the value of money raised dropping to its lowest point in a decade last year, according to Dealogic data. Turnover in equities, an indicator of market liquidity, rose 40 per cent in the six years to 2022 in the US but remained flat over the same period in Europe, according to data compiled by AFME, a banking lobby group.
But the EU’s plan to create a single database of live stock prices faces a final lobbying pushback from Europe’s stock exchanges, which argue handing over data deprives them of much-needed revenues and threatens the viability of some of the region’s smaller bourses.
“It may mean in smaller countries they would not have a listing venue anymore,” said Rainer Riess, director-general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, which represents 35 venues across the region.
The European Commission sees a so-called consolidated tape as a way to overcome the hurdle of fragmented European markets. Trading is scattered between national exchanges, alternative trading venues and private marketplaces. Such tapes have been a feature of US markets for decades.
The negotiations between member states, the European Commission and parliament, will try to clarify what a consolidated tape should look like. Brussels intends that it will be run by a private commercial company and funded by the market.
Many investors argue the structural problems in Europe have been exacerbated by the EU’s 2018 Mifid II markets rules, which have made it more difficult and expensive to track activity.
A tape “should lead Europe into being seen and operate as a truly single market”, said Adam Farkas, chief executive of AFME. “If you are sitting in Singapore or Hong Kong . . . and managing a fund there, you want to look at Europe as one single market.”
The 2018 rules mandated a tape be built but left it to the market to develop a solution. Efforts repeatedly foundered when they came up against national and commercial interests.
Natan Tiefenbrun, president of stock exchange operator CBOE Europe, said clients such as large US quantitative trading firms “want to come to Europe but are put off by the complexity, particularly in market data”.
But the debate has centred on when exactly trading data should be captured. FESE, which initially sought a 15-minute delay to the tape, has lobbied for the tape to largely consist of information after the trade is completed, and opposes constant real-time pre-trade data.
Susan Yavari, senior regulatory policy adviser at the European Fund and Asset Management Association, said opposition to a pre-trade tape was “shortsighted” because “[exchanges] want to protect existing data revenues”.
Exchanges earn lucrative fees from licensing their market data to customers such as high-frequency traders, hedge funds and banks — revenues that would be shared under the EU proposals. FESE estimates European venues earn about only €245mn from their data annually and Riess argues the data fees cover the maintenance of listings and growth markets and other services that rivals and banks do not provide.
“Even for some of the midsize players that would be a significant cut in their revenue where the viability of the exchange business for these players would be in question,” he said.
FESE also argues that the rules should include “systematic internalisers” — more lightly regulated invitation-only markets run largely by banks and high-frequency traders. Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, the region’s largest exchanges operator, has called proposals that exclude them as “diluting transparency, creating opacity”.
Boujnah, like FESE, has also warned that a tape containing pre-trade information will leave smaller investors exposed to predation, undermining Mifid II’s commitment to toughen protection for investors.
Larger traders will see the orders on the tape, then use faster and more sophisticated technology to take advantage of the difference in the price on an exchange hundreds of miles away, a tactic known as latency arbitrage, argues the exchange lobby group.
“If you are sending the data to the tape provider from Oslo, Athens, Cyprus . . . there’s a geographical latency that’s significantly bigger than the US,” Riess said, adding: “Some will know in advance what the tape will say, they will be able to arbitrage that.”
That argument is rejected by many asset managers. Yavari said smaller exchanges would actually benefit, not lose out. “Take Portugal or Croatia, you have to go proactively and see the data from that exchange. If you already have all the data in a consolidated tape then it’s all there, you have the visibility.”
“In the absence of [the data], it’s very difficult for us to showcase the true liquidity pool and that doesn’t help the growth of European capital markets more broadly,” said Jim Goldie, head of ETF capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Invesco."
"Retail investors lose out when brokers sell their orders, Dutch regulator warns",EU financial regulation,"The Dutch markets watchdog has warned that retail customers usually get a worse price when their trades are sent to venues that pay for investors’ orders, adding to intense regulatory scrutiny of the controversial practice.
A study by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), published on Wednesday, will add fuel to EU regulators’ scrutiny of payment for order flow, a process whereby brokers sell their customers’ orders to market intermediaries.
The AFM found customers were hit with a higher price in 70-85 per cent of cases than if those same orders were sent to more competitive markets.
By comparison, investors were better off when their trades went to venues also open to banks and fund managers, or Euronext, the primary European exchange — receiving an inferior price in less than a quarter of cases.
Payment for order flow has also been the subject of intense debate across the Atlantic.
Wall Street trading firms paid almost $3bn to retail brokers such as Robinhood to manage their trades in 2020, and $3.8bn last year, according to Bloomberg data. Regulatory focus on the practice intensified in early 2021 when the meme-stock frenzy fuelled a surge in payment for order flow, prompting Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren to express “troubling concerns” about the companies carrying out Robinhood’s trades.
The practice is not banned outright across the EU. But tough rules on inducements and finding the best price for clients mean most market participants find payment for order flow difficult to implement.
Even so, a few national regulators, including Germany’s financial watchdog, interpret the rules differently. Brussels has proposed a formal ban to ensure the rules are enforced across the bloc.
The uncertainty has created uneven rules in which some regional stock exchanges and alternative trading venues offer fees for orders. Other venues permit only one dedicated market maker to supply prices to buy and sell, with brokers selling their orders to that market maker.
The AFM’s study assessed two trading venues that relied on payment for order flow, one which did not and one low-cost retail broker. The study covered the first half of 2021. It found that retail investors received a better price only about 5-8 per cent of the time on a “PFOF venue”, which had paid for customers’ orders.
That proportion compared to only 1-2 per cent on more open markets. Using a broker, retail investors received a worse price in about a third of cases but were just as likely to get a better price.
The AFM’s analysis focused only on Dutch shares, but the watchdog said it had sent its model to other regulators in Europe to use for their own studies.
Market participants have been divided over a potential ban.
Trade Republic, a German trading platform with a million customers, has warned it would hurt retail investors. Virtu Financial, the US group, has urged European authorities not to pursue a ban and called on them to study the US market to understand how a “properly configured PFOF ecosystem” can benefit investors, according to a private submission to European Securities and Markets Authority last month and seen by the Financial Times. It has advocated explicit disclosures to all clients of retail brokers who receive payment for order flow.
“The US structure, formulated to ensure competition, best execution, and transparency, is not evident in the current EU market practices surrounding PFOF,” it warned.
Optiver, a Dutch market maker, has backed a ban, but cautioned that the wording of the AFM’s proposals would not curb other market practices that skirt the spirit of the rules."
"Egypt’s exchange rate uncertainty stifling business, say entrepreneurs",Egypt,"Egyptian entrepreneurs have warned that uncertainty over the exchange rate is suffocating business and impeding their ability to plan and invest, as the country endures its worst foreign currency crisis in years.
A series of devaluations since March last year has halved the value of the Egyptian pound against the dollar but failed to boost foreign exchange inflows. A new devaluation is expected, economists and business leaders say. Meanwhile, the dollar shortage has led to a black market in foreign currency.
The crisis began when foreign bond investors pulled about $20bn out of Egyptian debt following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, in a flight to havens.
Gulf states stepped in with $13bn in deposits and another $3.3bn in asset purchases, but portfolio investors have mostly stayed away and the private sector has struggled to fund imports.
Adham Nadim, who heads his family’s company Nadim Group, which makes furniture for hotels and corporate clients, said he was having problems importing crucial inputs such as hinges, accessories and paints.
“Everyone gives me speculative prices based on what they think the price of the dollar on the black market will be if I plan to purchase in two months,” he said. “It is a bigger problem if the project extends to six or 10 months.”
Samih Sawiris, a leading Egyptian tourism and real estate investor, told Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya television this month that the foreign exchange situation had deterred him from further investments in Egypt.
“Everyone is waiting for clarity on the exchange rate,” he said, describing the issue as “hurdle number one, two and three” for investors. “How can I know if a project would make profits or losses?” he said. “Which rate should I use — the international [forward] rate, the black market rate or the official rate?”
Central Bank of Egypt figures this month show imports dropped in the second half of 2022 to $37bn compared with $42bn in the same period the year before.
Remittances by Egyptians working abroad, an important source of foreign currency, also declined, from $15.5bn in the second half of 2021 to $12bn in the same period last year. Bankers attribute the drop to people selling their foreign exchange on the black market or holding on to it in the expectation of a devaluation of the pound.
The currency crisis has added to the pressure on a private sector already contending with soaring inflation, which reached 31.5 per cent in April, and a 19 per cent interest rate.
A senior Egyptian banker told the Financial Times that there was significant foreign currency in the country, raised from tourism and other sources, but that people were holding on to dollars in the expectation of getting more for them after a further devaluation.
As part of a $3bn loan package agreed with the IMF in October — its fourth since 2016 — Cairo agreed to move to a flexible exchange rate regime and reduce the footprint of the state in the economy. The fund said recently Egypt was “serious” about making the change.
Egyptian governments have traditionally been reluctant to allow market forces to determine the value of the pound, preferring to deploy foreign currency resources to prop up its value and maintain its stability against the dollar. The aim is to avoid inflation shocks caused by sharp falls in the local currency.
A Goldman Sachs report this month acknowledged Cairo’s dilemma. It argued that the near-term benefits of a depreciation in terms of&nbsp;increased exports and capital inflows “were not clear” and would depend on further economic reforms, while there was a risk of “exacerbating already high inflationary pressures”.&nbsp;
But it said the large parallel market foreign currency premium would result “in unsustainable economic distortions that make periodic devaluations of the pound highly likely in the medium term, regardless of whether the authorities move to a fully flexible exchange rate regime”.
Economists say the central bank wanted to build a foreign currency buffer before moving to a flexible exchange rate. In February the government unveiled a list of 32 state-owned companies it planned to open to private-sector participation by selling mainly minority stakes. Oil-rich Gulf states are the main target market for the privatisations.
However, the programme remains stalled amid reported differences over the exchange rate to be used to value Egyptian assets, as well as the small size of many of the stakes being offered, which would not give buyers management control.
Nonetheless, Mostafa Madbouly, prime minister, said this month the government would raise $2bn in asset sales before the end of June.
The main way to resolve the crisis in the longer term is to increase exports, economists say. “The country needs to move to an export-driven model to have sustained foreign currency revenue,” said Heike Harmgart, managing director for the southern and eastern Mediterranean region at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. “For this to happen . . . the private sector should get more room to breathe and grow.”
Nadim agreed the focus should be on industry to boost exports and create jobs. “Industry has not been a priority,” he said. “We are having our most difficult time in 45 years of operation. Today we are looking into a deep fog.”"
Investors snap up local currency bonds as dollar debt loses allure,Emerging market investing,"Investors are ploughing money into emerging market local currency bonds, as high interest rates and falling inflation make them increasingly attractive compared with dollar assets.
In the first four months of the year, investors withdrew a net $2.65bn from funds holding so-called hard currency — predominantly dollar-denominated — emerging market bonds, but added $5.23bn to local currency bond funds, according to fund flow data provider EPFR Global.
The flows mark a reversal of years of investors opting for dollar-denominated debt as a strong greenback broadly drove better and lower-risk returns. This year, the tables have turned with local bonds performing better, as currencies including the Mexican peso and Brazilian real have strengthened more than 10 per cent against the dollar.
“Local markets are far outperforming external debt,” said Paul Greer, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “Frankly I think that trend will probably continue for the rest of the year.”
This year JPMorgan’s emerging market benchmark for local currency government bonds has delivered a 6.8 per cent total return, outstripping a 1.9 per cent rise for its hard currency counterpart.
Analysts say much of that outperformance has been down to the fact that this year the dollar has weakened against many major developing country currencies that also offer higher rates of return. Such an uplift in return is known as “carry” in foreign exchange markets.
“The carry trade is front and centre of people’s minds,” said Manik Narain, head emerging market strategist at UBS. “There is a strong consensus to be short the dollar, on the basis of the Fed having reached the end of its tightening cycle.”
Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has indicated that the central bank was preparing to hold off on another rate rise next month. However, it has been more cautious as to when rate cuts will commence.
Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global foreign exchange, rates and emerging markets strategy at Goldman Sachs, said investors were still keen on the trade.
“The view being that with the Fed on pause, that should lower interest rate volatility and create some room for investors to earn the risk premium on offer in specific higher-yielding emerging market foreign exchange,” he said.
While some analysts think emerging market currencies will struggle to continue to outperform the dollar, especially against a backdrop of concerns about the US debt ceiling or a US recession, many still see reasons to hold local currency bonds.
“We have seen a clear divergence between emerging market local and hard currency bonds over the past few quarters with local currency debt looking more attractive on a fundamental and valuation basis,” said Thanos Papasavvas, chief investment officer at ABP Invest.
Many emerging market central banks started raising their interest rates before the Fed did and were able to tame inflation quicker. For countries where interest rates remain high, that has improved the real yields on offer to investors.
In Brazil, for example, the policy interest rate has been 13.75 per cent since last August while April’s inflation print showed annual price rises of 4.15 per cent. In Mexico, the policy rate rose to 11.25 per cent in April while annual inflation eased to 5.3 per cent.
Added to attractive emerging market real yields, the Fed is widely thought to have finished its rate rising cycle with markets pricing in cuts of about 0.7 percentage points before the end of the year.
“Earlier hiking cycles, falling inflation and signs that the US tightening cycle has peaked have given an opportunity in emerging market debt local rates,” said Steve Ryder, a senior portfolio manager at Aviva Investors.
“We like being overweight Mexican bonds both outright and versus the US as we believe the central bank is also close to its peak in interest rates, and with inflation expectations continuing to fall we believe the case for rate cuts is growing” Ryder said. Falling interest rates make bond prices rise and yields fall.
Goldman picked Brazil, Hungary and Mexico as its chosen “carry candidates” and warned against the South African rand, which hit a record low against the dollar last week after the US accused South Africa of supplying arms to Russia in a covert naval operation.
Nevertheless, many investors remain cautious on the outlook for emerging market assets, with positioning still low compared with historical levels.
“Confidence is very low,” said David Hauner, head of EM cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Global Research. “People are very long cash and waiting for trends to emerge.”
Like Narain at UBS, he said some investors had taken an overly rosy view of the outlook for US rate cuts, which BofA did not expect to begin before next year.
Even so, he said, the question was now when rather than whether the Fed would begin cutting.
“Inflows to EM local currency debt will start to accelerate when there is more confidence in the beginning of the Fed’s cutting cycle,” he said. “Everybody is waiting for that green light.”"
European gas prices back in normal range for first time since energy crisis,Energy crisis,"European natural gas prices fell back into their normal trading range for the first time since the start of the energy crisis on Thursday, falling below €30 per megawatt hour to reach the lowest level since June 2021.
The price of benchmark TTF fell as low as €29.75/mwh, down more than 8 per cent on the day, to levels last seen before Russia started squeezing Europe’s pipeline gas supplies ahead of its invasion of Ukraine. TTF later rose slightly to close at €30/mwh.
The low prices are in stark contrast to last summer, when TTF soared to more than ten times its normal level, peaking above €340/mwh after Russia slashed gas exports to Europe. The decline highlights how Europe has largely overcome the worst of Moscow’s weaponisation of energy supplies.
The drop is also a sign on the ample amount already in storage as traders refill ahead of next winter, and relatively tepid gas demand in the region.
Europe ended the winter with gas storage well above the seasonal average, and has continued to build up its inventory. Storage is now nearly 65 per cent full and nearly a fifth above the previous 5-year average, according to industry body Gas Infrastructure Europe.
“Back in January I was saying we would see prices fall below €30/mwh over the summer. But I certainly was not expecting it as early as May,” said Tom Marzec-Manser at energy consultancy ICIS.
Since the end of March, the TTF price has fallen for six consecutive weeks, plunging nearly 27 per cent.
“Will we see more downside on the short-term contracts? Yes, no doubt,” Marzec-Manser said. He added that a lack of demand for spot liquefied natural gas&nbsp;from Asia, which competed with Europe for the super-chilled fuel throughout last year, was another factor in European gas prices trending lower.
Despite the fall in prices, traders and analysts remain cautious as the global gas market remains finely balanced. Russia’s pipeline flows to Europe, which cannot be redirected to other export markets, are still 90 per cent lower than before the invasion of Ukraine. Russia once met around 40 per cent of EU demand.
The International Energy Agency, in its most recent quarterly gas market report, said the demand and supply balance for global gas “is subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainties” this year, ranging from weather, availability of LNG and the possibility of further declines in Russian pipeline gas to Europe.
But even if prices start to rise again as winter approaches few expect they will scale anywhere near the levels seen at the height of the crisis.
Prior to Russia starting to squeeze supplies in 2021 — before slashing them after invading — TTF had traded close to €30/mwh but never above."
A ban on short selling is a bad idea,Equities,"The writer is a partner with Delta Strategy Group. He was previously chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission
Following weeks of declining prices for US regional bank stocks, short selling of equity shares is once again coming under scrutiny with calls for more regulatory oversight of the practice. In a letter to clients this past week, a major Wall Street law firm argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission should impose a 15-trading day prohibition on short sales of the stock of financial institutions. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has also called on regulators to look into the behaviour of short sellers.
I was the SEC’s chief economist during the 2008 financial crisis, the last time regulators banned the practice of short selling, an investment strategy in which an investor borrows shares from long-term holders with the expectation share prices will decline. Based on my experience, I believe any new regulatory intervention banning short selling would be a huge mistake.
The SEC’s longstanding view has been that this practice plays an important role in promoting market quality and helping investors by contributing to price discovery, liquidity, risk management and by lowering the overall cost of trading and raising capital. The 2008 ban was a departure from this view.
Emergency authority was used to ban short selling in 799 financial stocks (eventually over 900 stocks).&nbsp;This was part of then Treasury secretary Henry Paulson’s “shock and awe” approach to the crisis, and came amid concerns that short selling was causing sudden and excessive fluctuations in share prices of financial institutions. Paulson’s aim was to alter investor perceptions, bolster confidence, stabilise markets and prevent excessive price declines in financial shares. The ban was lifted three weeks after it was imposed.
Its effects were extensively studied by SEC economists and by a number of academic researchers. The results of these studies paint a uniform picture of a policy that clearly failed any reasonable cost/benefit test. The ban failed to slow the decline in the price of financial stocks and many market participants were harmed without any offsetting benefit. The studies showed the ban worked in at least one way: shorting activity declined significantly for affected stocks.
Importantly, these studies revealed that the premise for the ban — that short sales were more aggressive than the sales made by those holding shares and wishing to dispose of them — was mistaken. They also showed that short selling of financial shares was more intense in rising markets, not falling ones.
Furthermore, the studies found the ban was counterproductive, as it led to a severe degradation in market quality by increasing intraday stock price volatility, reducing market liquidity, increasing bid-ask spreads and price impacts, reducing pricing efficiency and increasing trading costs. It led to a substitution of other instruments to gain short exposure, such as equity swaps or credit default swaps. The studies documented impaired arbitrage and hedging processes caused by the ban leading some traders to unwind their positions, resulting in additional selling pressure on financial shares.
Finally, many exchange traded funds that depend on short exposure halted the creation of new shares. The result was many ETFs trading at a premium to their net asset value since there were no new shares created to meet demand.
The compelling body of evidence documenting the harmful effects of the 2008 ban led leaders at that time to conclude it had been counterproductive. As the then chair of the SEC, Christopher Cox, was preparing to leave the agency, he said agreeing to it had been his biggest mistake. Today’s SEC should review the lessons of 2008 and make sure it does not get pressured into repeating the error.

A short seller’s bear necessities&nbsp;/&nbsp;From Paul Fellerman, London NW7, UK"
Why Europe’s stock markets are failing to challenge the US,Equities,"In 2006 the London Stock Exchange scoffed at the overseas suitors casting eyes in its direction.
At the time, bourses in Europe were locked in a dizzying dance of potential marriages. Several of the biggest had already united to form Euronext. Germany was trying to position itself as a global leader. Supersized US rivals were circling, looking to snap up European markets and create transatlantic powerhouses for listings and trading.
Europe had a certain swagger, a confidence that its tie-ups could pose a serious challenge to Wall Street, which was still sitting in the shadow of the dotcom crash and a slew of corporate scandals. The LSE in particular, with its historic prestige, stood resolute, spiky and defensive. It had already deflected several potential partners, including Frankfurt’s Deutsche Börse, and would go on to rebuff more.
London had a “unique global position”, the LSE reasoned, built on the City’s deep investor base and top-notch financial services industry. That whole ecosystem, not merely scale, would be the foundation to keep attracting companies all over the world looking for a stock market home.
In this series, the FT explores why some of Europe’s most promising companies are fleeing to America’s capital market
Part 1: Britain’s ‘capitalism without capital’: pension funds that shun risk
One financial crisis, a shock UK exit from the EU and a global pandemic later, and it is clear all sides got it wrong. US markets remain the undisputed home for listing and trading shares in the world’s most dynamic and fast-growing companies. London is failing to attract glitzy initial public offerings and is even losing some of its most reliable names. Other European markets are parochial and shallow and still bear a strong whiff of the old economy, dominated by banks and industrial companies.
Investors say the European dream of building an equity investment scene to rival the US remains distant and the path towards its creation is strewn with practical, political and cultural obstacles. Even if European exchanges tweak listing rules in an effort to draw in new companies, the US has a strong lead that could take decades to reel in as the world slowly adjusts to the end of the easy money era that pumped up America’s corporate champions.
“The US has had this very positive feedback loop in tech and with high-growth companies,” says Euan Munro, chief executive at the UK’s Newton Investment Management. “That created coverage and excitement, people got invested in it and there was no real short-term pressure . . . to show [corporate] profitability. People were happy to buy growth, it was its own reward.”
In Europe, by contrast, “there’s sometimes been a sniffiness about corporates making money, about people participating in growth, that the US does not see”.
After the Covid-19 outbreak, global central banks cut interest rates and propped up bond markets to support flailing economies. In response, 2021 smashed records for stock market listings as asset prices surged and companies jumped on to public markets. The enthusiasm was so pronounced that the US rediscovered a craze for special-purpose acquisition companies or Spacs — blank-cheque companies that list on exchanges essentially as a pot of cash, and then hunt down and gobble up other firms, providing those targets with an easy route to a listing.
But by 2022, the environment had changed dramatically. Global stocks fell about 20 per cent last year as central banks yanked up interest rates to tackle inflation, and dozens of Spacs imploded. Investors were no longer in the mood for speculative bets on companies yet to turn a profit. The unprecedented rush of initial public offerings hit a wall.
Europe and the UK also fared dismally. The value of European listings in 2022 dropped to its lowest point in a decade, according to Dealogic data. Just one deal — the €75bn listing of carmaker Porsche in Frankfurt — accounted for 60 per cent of the total amount raised. In the UK, newly listed companies raised 90 per cent less in 2022 than the heights of 2021, with just 45 companies listing in London, according to LSE data. Only six of those raised more than £100mn of new money.
The massive outperformance of the US in recent years — both in terms of listing numbers and in the valuations that companies there can command — was a product of the two factors: the technology scene in Silicon Valley, and the ultra-loose monetary policy that drove cash into riskier assets such as equities.
“There has always been a very developed tech investor base in the US,” says Valery Barrier, co-head of European equity capital markets at Citi in Paris. Particularly in the decade or so after the financial crisis, that was the sector most in demand.
In the early 2000s, the rapid growth and development of “mammoth companies” in the US, including Apple and Google, meant European investors and tech companies fell further behind those across the Atlantic, Barrier says. “All this ecosystem goes hand in hand, more tech investors means more tech companies. All this creates a virtuous cycle.”
The result, according to bankers and other trading executives, was to starve European companies of much-needed capital to fuel their growth. “The fact that we don’t have enough pension money invested in Europe does not affect large-caps, it really affects mid-caps and small-caps,” says Anthony Attia, global head of primary markets and post trade at Euronext.
The UK in particular has suffered from a dearth of domestic investment in its stocks, with pension funds’ holdings of UK-listed equities plunging from 50 per cent of their asset allocation to just 4 per cent in two decades after changes to accounting rules incentivised them to buy government bonds instead. That compares with Australia and Canada, both of which also have stock markets dominated by “old economy” companies but have 22 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, of their pension assets in equities.
Antoine de Guillenchmidt, co-head of European equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs, says European stock exchange executives regularly ask him what more they can do to attract high-quality companies to list.
“The one thing that you should be promoting that is not under your direct control is having an ecosystem of asset management firms that are European or local that want to invest with the same type of weight and forceful approach [as] their US counterparts,” he tells them. The IPOs that his bank runs tend to have “a very large proportion of US funds or the European arm of US funds taking part”.
Private equity has stepped into this void. The decade of easy money and record-low interest rates fuelled the expansion of private equity groups on both sides of the Atlantic, allowing them to scoop up companies at low valuations using cheap and readily available financing.
Ironically, the exits for private equity firms are slowly getting bricked up. The more public equity markets deteriorate, the harder it is for private equity firms to monetise their investments in companies through a listing, leaving them either holding businesses for longer periods or selling them to other private buyers. US and European private equity groups on average held companies for six-and-a-half years by 2022, compared with just over four years in 2000, according to PitchBook data. “We need to find the right moments to support these private investors in their exits,” says Attia.
The overall number of listed companies has been shrinking across the world in recent years, partly because easy money meant owners could easily finance their growth without going public. But again, Europe fared worse, with many of its most promising technology companies opting to float in the US; they include UK-based luxury clothing retailer Farfetch and Swedish music streamer Spotify in 2018 and Swiss trainers company On Running in 2021. Chip designer Arm, for years one of the LSE’s only significant tech companies before it was acquired by SoftBank in 2016, is also set to relist in New York.
Spacs also sucked in nascent European companies that local investors eyed with distrust, including the car retailer Cazoo and healthcare company Babylon. Europe even started losing existing companies; since 2000, 221 have headed to US exchanges to list, more than double the tally heading the other way, according to Dealogic. Those choosing the US have raised in total nearly four times the money of US companies that chose Europe.
Among the most notable was the €145bn German industrial giant Linde, which delisted from Frankfurt last month, leaving its sole listing in New York and depriving Deutsche Börse of its most valuable company.
“I don’t think you can hope to replicate the US in Europe or vice versa,” says Barrier at Citi. “We have global champions in Europe but they grow on a smaller domestic base before they can have international ambitions.”
US exchanges have spotted the weakness and are courting European companies, enticing them to list by highlighting the vastly bigger pool of capital and breadth of investors available across the Atlantic.
Cassandra Seier, head of international capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange, says the NYSE undertakes a lot of outreach. “We have members located on the ground in various regions,” she says. “We want companies that are trying to attract US capital to be listed here, it doesn’t matter which country you originate from, it doesn’t matter what size you are.”
Attia, of Euronext, says Europe’s biggest exchange operator has shifted its competitive focus. “Before Brexit we were pitching against the LSE. Now we don’t pitch against LSE at all — we pitch against Nasdaq,” he says, adding that over the past two years the European exchange has not lost a battle against its tech-focused US rival.
Euronext has grown in recent years through a series of acquisitions. It now provides a single platform for the exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Milan and others, as well as a clearing house.
But even after decades of talk about a pan-European capital market, the region remains fragmented, with numerous exchanges, clearing houses and settlement venues, as well as a patchwork of national securities laws. All of this is a stark contrast with the simpler environment in the US, where there is a one main regulator for securities and one clearing house, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, handles all clearing and settlement.
Andreas Bernstorff, head of equity capital markets at BNP Paribas, says the disjointed nature of listing venues across Europe remains a big impediment. “The problem Europe has is the fact that it has [so many] exchanges. Liquidity concentration is a problem for European capital markets . . . London has been downgraded as a neutral place to go and Amsterdam is an alternative.”
The EU has proposed a series of changes to make it less costly and cumbersome for small and medium-sized companies to go public in Europe, including shortening the IPO offer period from six to three days and standardising offering prospectuses across the bloc.
British officials are also seeking to make changes, including consulting on the role of British pension funds in the domestic equity market. “Real change requires both financial and an ongoing sustained commitment from all parts of the ecosystem,” says Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
Some investors say the fragmented environment in Europe suits their needs. The US may be more fast-paced, with more trading and a deeper pool of investors, but what it gains in quantity it may also lose in quality. There is an indulgence of lavish executive pay that would be societally more problematic in Europe, along with two-tier ownership structures that often confer more rights on founders at the expense of other shareholders.
The US is also prone to manias. Luc Mouzon, head of equity capital markets at Amundi, Europe’s biggest investment house, describes the Spac boom as “a crazy market, a clown show”, while Bernstorff says it marked “the peak of silliness” in the low interest rate age.
Mouzon adds that in 2022, “our view on valuations [in Europe] was heard. It was more rational. There were fewer IPOs, I agree, but from our point of view it was much better.” He adds that a successful listing “is one where five to eight years later, we’re still there . . . It doesn’t have to be a splash and you don’t have to capitalise on it in a couple of months.”
Two things could help Europe to develop some momentum. One is the macroeconomic environment; the re-emergence of inflation and the resulting sharp rises in interest rates mean investors are no longer so willing to speculate on companies that promise to make a profit sometime in the future. Instead, they increasingly covet the more staid and steady dividend-paying companies that Europe has in abundance.
“[Inflation] has profound consequences for how you structure a portfolio,” says Munro, at Newton. It hits bond prices and stings speculative bets on stocks, he explains. “Now even older people are thinking about investing in equities with income.”
The other factor, perhaps ironically, is Brexit. The UK, looking for deregulation opportunities following its departure from the EU, is imbued with a new determination to revamp its still-formidable financial services industry. If it succeeds, and manages to rejuvenate London’s stock market in the process, that would intensify the pressure on the EU to respond in kind.
“I don’t think it’s a lost cause at all,” says Nathalia Barazal, co-head of Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “When you feel the cold wind of being irrelevant it’s a catalyst, a kick in the butt. Either you do something, or you lose.”

EU must learn the right capital markets lessons / From Yuriko Backes, Luxembourg Minister of Finance and Magdalena Rzeczkowska, Polish Minister of Finance

"EU stock trading plans risk hurting small investors, warns Euronext CEO",Euronext NV,"The head of Europe’s largest exchange operator has criticised the EU’s proposed creation of a central stock trading database, warning that retail investors risk falling victim to more sophisticated traders.
Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, told the Financial Times that plans for a consolidated live database of stock and bond prices trading across Europe could create a wealth of trading opportunities for bigger firms with greater reach, while harming smaller investors by leaving them unable to access the best prices.
“Real time means being [ . . .] a victim of arbitrage,” he said. “We are sceptical of the benefit of a pre-trade consolidated tape,” he added, referring to an element of the proposed prices database.
EU officials are conducting a review to try and make Europe’s capital markets more efficient and thus attractive to investors. Exchange operators, brokers and asset managers are among those who have been lobbying legislators aggressively on the plans for months.
Among the most contentious proposals is the potential introduction of a consolidated tape — a live database designed to overcome the region’s issue of patchwork trading venues and data feeds. The European Commission is seeking to follow in the footsteps of the US where the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other trading venues jointly publish real time equity data including prices and share volumes.
A pre-trade consolidated tape would show real time price information, while a post-trade tape would record completed transactions.
Those opposing a pre-trade tape argue that retail investors in particular would lose out by not being able to access all the trading venues open to institutional players such as hedge funds and lightning-fast computer-driven traders, which will find it easier to exploit price anomalies.
Boujnah is in favour of a post-trade tape but said a pre-trade database risked creating “arbitrage opportunities against those [investors] with low rated platforms” that cannot easily access all trading venues, and that “a non-level playing field is really creating fragmentation of price formation and diluting transparency, creating opacity”.
Paris-based think-tank Eurofi wrote last year that “retail investors who are not able to engage in price arbitrage between a variety of markets, unlike high-frequency traders, will probably not benefit that much from a real-time consolidated tape”.
Data providers have largely backed the proposals. Euronext is one of 14 exchanges that have agreed to collaborate on providing an equities tape across the EU. However, Boujnah said he would prefer a “real-time post trade [tape] supplemented with a snapshot of pre trades” rather than constant real time pre-trade price information.
A consolidated tape will require exchanges that supply data to share revenues. The Federation of European Securities Exchanges last year pointed to a “potential threat of a real-time [consolidated tape] to the viability of smaller exchanges”.
Asset managers are largely in favour of the move to a consolidated tape. The European Fund and Asset Management Association, which represents more than 4,500 asset managers in the EU, has advocated for its creation, saying it would provide investors with greater transparency.
The European parliament’s Economic Committee is set to begin negotiations on the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Mifir) review proposal with the European Council of member states and the Commission with the aim of reaching an agreement later this year.
Boujnah also called for “systematic internalisers”, which are investment firms such as banks that can execute trades off exchange, to be treated like stock exchanges. “The only place where a price should be formed is a proper order book, not in a sort of shadow price record,” he said. He added that such firms act “like a type of Uber that are allowed not to abide by the driving code” and if they grow too large then “that can create potentially . . . all sorts of systemic risk and stress”.
Boujnah also called for a ban on payment for order flow, the controversial trading practice that was thrust into the limelight during 2021’s meme stock frenzy, whereby retail brokers make money by selling their customers’ orders to large trading firms.
“We hope the [EU Mifir negotiations] will focus on what is good to reduce fragmentation and increase transparency,” he added."
The digital euro: a solution seeking a problem?,European Central Bank,"When more than 1,000 demonstrators marched through the streets of Amsterdam in early February, they directed their ire at something that does not even exist: the digital euro.
The protesters voiced a kaleidoscopic array of objections to the European Central Bank’s plan to issue an electronic version of the continent’s single currency. Some feared the state would use it to track and control their spending, while others suspected a plot to replace cash. One protester told Dutch media she feared the authorities would stop her buying meat or alcohol.
Willem Engel, the event’s organiser who was a ringleader for Dutch opposition to Covid-19 vaccines, whipped up the crowd by telling them to “avoid companies that don’t accept cash”.
This cocktail of suspicions and conspiracy theories about the digital euro comes at a highly delicate moment for the ECB and eurozone politicians. On the one hand, they are eager to step up preparations for the digital currency over the next few months, with the hope that it could be launched in as little as three years’ time.
Yet at the same time, they are also struggling to communicate convincing arguments for the project, which is only increasing the scope for conjecture about the plans.
While China has the most advanced plans for a central bank digital currency among the larger economies, Europe is the furthest ahead among the main western central banks. Christine Lagarde has embraced the project since taking over as ECB president in 2019 from Mario Draghi, who barely mentioned the idea.
The Frankfurt-based institution is expected to announce in October that it will move into an implementation phase and start a pilot scheme. Lagarde has said she expects it will be ready to make the final decision of whether to launch a digital euro in 2026 or 2027.
This summer the European Commission will set out legislative proposals setting out some of the key design features of the putative currency, a landmark step towards that goal.
Supporters of the project say it would modernise European payments by giving people an electronic alternative to cash that is riskless and universally accepted.
“We need a risk-free asset and the only one that exists is central bank currency,” Fabio Panetta, the ECB executive board member overseeing its digital euro work, told the Financial Times.
Always jealous of the dominant position of the dollar in the international financial system, Europe is eager to find new ways of promoting the euro’s weight globally. It is also wary that China’s digital currency will allow Beijing to expand its role. Like other central banks, the ECB is also concerned that privately controlled digital currencies will gain traction in the financial system as consumers increasingly shun cash.
However, there are mounting questions among consumers, financiers and politicians over exactly what the project actually aims to achieve and whether the potential risks outweigh the benefits.
These questions have only grown as the immediate threat from cryptocurrencies has faded along with the decline in the value of bitcoin and other rival forms of money. The subtleties of central bank currencies are hard for policymakers to explain: many people consider they are already in effect using digital money when they use their contactless payment card or mobile banking app, rather than cash.
Some European policymakers fear that a failure to make a clear case for the digital euro will undermine the project before it is even born — that it will come to be seen as a solution that does not quite know what problem it is solving.
“What is the compelling reason for making this reform? This is the big unanswered question,” says Ignazio Angeloni, a former ECB official who is now a part-time professor at the European University Institute in Florence. “I don’t see any big failures in the market that require the public sector to step in and provide a digital euro.”
The idea of creating a digital euro first emerged a few years ago as a defensive response to Facebook’s idea of launching a virtual currency of its own, which policymakers feared could undermine the ECB’s control of the money supply.
Since then, the US social media group’s digital currency, known initially as Libra and then Diem, has largely fizzled out. Yet the ECB is still pressing ahead.
A key motivation for the ECB is the declining use of cash, which has fallen from 79 per cent of all point-of-sale transactions in the eurozone in 2016 to 59 per cent last year, according to a recent survey by the central bank. The proportion of people in the bloc preferring to pay with cash has fallen from 32 per cent to 22 per cent in the past six years.
Officials say cash acts as an important stabilising force in the financial system by giving people access to a means of payment that is riskless because it is backed by the central bank. People are happy to deposit money at commercial banks in part because they know they can withdraw it as cash at any time, officials say. The digital euro is designed to preserve this role as cash usage declines.
“Digitisation of society means everyone wants to pay digitally,” Panetta says. “But there is no single digital means of payment you can use everywhere in the euro area. Visa or Mastercard are controlled by non-European companies and are widely used, but many shops do not accept them. Even cash is not accepted everywhere.”
Policymakers worry that Europe lacks its own payments champion, leaving it overly reliant on the likes of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal or even Apple, which recently launched savings accounts and a credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs.
There is also a fear that as cash usage falls, people could switch to other means of payment, including stablecoins, which are digital tokens backed by fiat currency, or digital currencies launched by other countries, such as China’s planned digital renminbi.
“If the sovereign doesn’t offer this, then others will take its place,” says Panetta. “We want to build an app that ensures you can pay with the digital euro in the same way in every part of the euro area.”
The ECB is keen to stress that it sees the digital euro as a complement to cash and not a replacement for it. It plans to build the infrastructure and to issue the tokens for the new system but to leave the day-to-day operations to commercial banks.
Consumers are likely to be offered the chance to buy digital euros through their commercial bank, rather than direct from the ECB. The new tokens are unlikely to earn interest and may be held in a separate app provided by their bank, but otherwise they could be largely indistinguishable from regular bank deposits.
It has something to do with how you define yourself as a nation and how the monetary system operates in your country — this is not a technical thing
The banking sector has given a lukewarm response to the idea. Executives worry that the digital euro will make bank runs more likely by acting as a safe haven into which people can transfer their money during a crisis. The European Banking Federation warns of “a significant risk for banks due to the potential shift of significant funds that are currently held as bank deposits to digital euro accounts/wallets”.
To counter this, the ECB is considering imposing a limit on how many digital euros anyone can hold of about €3,000, or a punitive interest rate on holdings above a certain level.
But others argue the project is more seriously flawed, fearing that the ECB plans to add to inefficiency and complexity by creating a duplicate payments system that would only be used by the digital euro.
“Parallel payments systems could tie up capital and liquidity, the new system would likely face the same pain points, and it would be expensive,” says Tim Adams, chief executive of banking lobby group the Institute of International Finance.
Bankers fret about having to shoulder the costs for such a major project with little upside, especially as the ECB has said basic payments with the digital euro should be free. The EBF says “public funding should be made available to support the investments that will be required” and recommends that merchants pay fees for accepting digital euro payments.
The Eurogroup, which convenes the finance ministers of the countries that share the euro, has been debating the topic intensively alongside the ECB since 2021. Discussions at a political level have been dominated by technicalities, as ministers struggle to get to grips with an enormously complex project.
Recently ministers have become increasingly conscious of the need to get out and make a more proactive case to households. This, officials admit, is not easily done given the complexity of the economic arguments behind the project and the ease with which consumers already transact with their mobile phones and payment cards.
Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch finance minister, told colleagues privately at a meeting in March that it was difficult to explain to citizens why a digital euro was needed, not least given the eurozone’s payment system was already reliable and innovative, according to people familiar with the meeting. There was a need for politicians to get out and explain what the benefits of the currency would be, and to make them tangible, she argued, without which the new project might not be accepted.
“I accept that we may not yet have made the use case sufficiently clear for consumers,” Paschal Donohoe, president of the Eurogroup, told the FT. “The value of concepts like financial stability [is] sometimes only understood in their absence . . . if a decision is made to move towards the realisation phase, more will need to be done to educate and explain to consumers.”&nbsp;
The European Commission is preparing draft legislation that aims to provide the legal framework underpinning the digital euro. Among the outstanding questions officials are grappling with is how to hardwire limits on digital euro accounts. Another is how to address the privacy concerns dogging the concept — a point that has been heavily stressed by Kaag, among others.
Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial services commissioner, has insisted the digital euro will not be a “big brother” project. Officials say households are already surrendering far greater privacy to private sector tech giants via the use of their mobile phones and apps. But ministers are acutely aware of the risks that the project gets tarnished by a perception that it is a vehicle for government snooping on households’ spending.
The ECB aims to address privacy fears — the main worry for more than 40 per cent of respondents to its initial consultation — by keeping users’ identities separate from payment data unless criminal activity is suspected.
“We will design it in a way that means we cannot track if you have been to the bakery, or whatever,” Evelien Witlox, head of the ECB’s digital euro project, said on a podcast recently.
Given the proliferation of government-backed digital currencies around the world, officials feel that they have little choice but to plough ahead in the eurozone as they seek to promote the single currency’s global status. Alongside a handful of fully live retail CBDCs, including Nigeria, Jamaica and the Bahamas, are pilots in 34 jurisdictions covering wholesale and retail CDBCs, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Sweden’s Riksbank has been one of the early movers in the field after starting its e-krona project in 2017. Stefan Ingves, the former governor of the central bank, says that with people gradually moving out of cash in technologically advanced countries including his, the public sector needs to develop its own digital currency. “It has something to do with how you define yourself as a nation and how the monetary system operates in your country — this is not a technical thing,” he says.
“If you want to hold something really safe, that thing is central bank money.” Households do not need to buy into the central bank digital currency on a massive scale, he adds. “You just need to start somewhere”.
The decline of cash by no means guarantees that consumers will embrace an official digital currency instead, however. Arguably the most closely watched of the various projects has been the digital renminbi in China. While the central bank has been expanding the number of pilots under way, paying more civil servants in digital renminbi for example, take-up has remained puny. The People’s Bank of China says only Rmb13.61bn ($1.9bn) of the digital currency was circulating at the end of last year. That was 0.13 per cent of the currency in circulation.
Part of the problem is that private sector offerings such as Alipay and WeChat Pay are already widely used, and it is not obvious what advantages the official digital currency confers.
In Europe, the case for CBDCs recently suffered a further setback. Sweden has one the lowest levels of cash usage in the world — with only a third of the population now using it regularly, down from almost 80 per cent in 2016. This should make it fertile ground for a CBDC, but a government-appointed investigator concluded in March it “currently does not see a strong enough societal need” for an e-krona.
If there were a case for continuing exploratory work, it was a defensive one. Sweden’s strong links to the eurozone “raise questions about whether a digital euro in the longer term could lead to the euro being used for payments in Sweden to a greater extent”, the investigator found. This “could make monetary policy less effective” as well as creating risks for financial stability. Accordingly, the Riksbank was told to keep looking into it and come back with a proposal next year on whether to launch an e-krona.
For the ECB, a big challenge is deciding how successful it wants the digital euro to be. Huw van Steenis, a former Bank of England adviser now at consultants Oliver Wyman, calls this the “Goldilocks CBDC” issue — wanting to avoid a flop but not to create something so popular it undermines the banks. “The elephant in the room is that we have just seen what a digital-paced bank run looks like, for the 100-plus central banks investigating them it means we should pause for careful reflection before deciding to mint a CBDC,” he says.
For the euro area there is a risk at the margin that a dollar-based stablecoin could come to dominate cross-border payments
Panetta believes that by setting a limit on holdings at about €3,000, the ECB can get the balance right. “The objective is not to gain a large market share,” he says. “We don’t want to become dominant or challenge the banks. If the digital euro becomes a familiar payment option among Europeans that is fine by me.”
But others say tightly restricting a person’s digital euro holdings undermines the currency’s attractions. “It is like alcohol-free wine,” says Peter Bofinger, an economics professor at the University of Würzburg, who recently wrote a paper on the digital euro with a colleague. The enforced abstinence imposed on the digital euro will convince people it’s not worth bothering with at all, he argues. “I cannot see how this will not fail.”
Ultimately, whether the ECB goes ahead with a digital euro could depend on what others do. Unlike the US, which benefits from the dominant position of the dollar in international trade and reserves, the euro is in a weaker position. With geopolitical tensions intensifying, ECB officials are already uneasy at how much Europe relies on foreign companies for much of its payments system — even if many are US-based.
“For the euro area there is a risk at the margin that a dollar-based stablecoin could come to dominate cross-border payments,” says Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and author of The Future of Money. The euro, he says, has already lost ground in international usage to the renminbi and the dollar, and policymakers are anxious to reverse that trend.
Ensuring the currency is available in digital form therefore might, he argues, “be more of an imperative for Europe”.&nbsp;

Human rights rules could give bankers a run for their money,European Union,"This article is an on-site version of our Moral Money newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox.

Welcome back. Yesterday, a committee of lawmakers in Brussels held an important vote on a new EU law that could sharply increase the level of oversight that companies need to exercise over their supply chains. Some analysts are concerned about the outlook for the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. It could still be watered down in the European parliament, or by EU member governments. And whatever happens, it won’t come into force until 2030.
Still, as Kenza explains below, this is an important law that could have a big impact. Also in today’s newsletter, I look at an unusual new study that hints at where companies are getting it wrong on diversity, equity and inclusion. (Simon Mundy)
PS Join the FT tomorrow at 17:00 BST for a free webinar on the challenges facing banks and investment firms in the US and Europe and how they should deal with them.
It has been a decade since the Rana Plaza garment factory collapsed in Bangladesh, killing more than 1,000 people who had been making clothes for fashion brands such as Primark and Benetton.
To prevent this kind of disaster from happening again, regulators have been working on an overhaul of due diligence obligations.
Draft rules approved by the EU parliament’s legal committee yesterday would force large companies that do business in the bloc to identify and prevent environmental and human rights risks in their supply chain for the first time.
The most controversial change? The requirements would also be slapped on to the financial sector — and directors’ bonuses could be on the line. This comes despite strong opposition from some EU ministers and finance sector lobby groups.
Banks, insurers and asset managers could face fines of up to 5 per cent of global revenues for financing or underwriting companies accused of human rights and environmental violations.
They will also have to publish transition plans in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. And, for those with at least 1,000 employees, director pay will have to be linked in some way to the quality of these transition plans.
“This is on paper the most significant piece of law the financial sector has faced,” Richard Gardiner, head of EU policy at the Dutch non-profit World Benchmarking Alliance, told Moral Money. “It would mandate them to identify and mitigate real world risks for the first time.”
One drawback for proponents of tougher ESG standards is that investors will be told to “engage” with shareholders — but will not be hit with the same level of due diligence requirements as companies. Activists say this could mean an asset manager has to do full due diligence on its office coffee suppliers but not its cattle ranch investments.
The rules must still be debated in the EU parliament, and would not fully come into force until the 2030s.
If successful, this would be the first bloc-wide due diligence regulation focused on taking action rather than just disclosing data. It targets all global companies with at least €40mn in turnover within the EU, or local ones of a similar size and 250 or more employees.
Non-financial companies could be sued by victims for harms caused by their suppliers, a big step up from existing rules focused only on data disclosures.
The directive covers child labour, modern day slavery and other social harms, but also environmental problems such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, air or water pollution and waste.
“Beyond the financial sector this is important for every company . . . nothing else like this exists,” Adrián Vázquez Lázara, the liberal lawmaker who is head of the legal committee, told Moral Money. (Kenza Bryan)
Nowadays nearly all major companies trumpet the priority they give to diversity, equity and inclusion — but how can you tell which ones are actually taking action?
The most obvious approach is to analyse the data disclosed on the gender and racial mix of companies’ boards or management team, or of their wider workforce. But while these can give a broad sense of diversity at a company, they tell you little about equity and inclusion as perceived by the people who work there.
A recent study, led by Alex Edmans at London Business School — who’s built a reputation for shaking up the consensus on ESG — has tried to do better.
It used a valuable but so far underexploited data set: responses to the surveys used to create Fortune’s annual list of the US’s best companies to work for.
That survey, carried out by the consultancy Great Place To Work, uses employee responses to dozens of questions to compile a list of 100 companies where staff wellbeing is highest. Edmans and his collaborators — Caroline Flammer at Columbia University and Simon Glossner of the Federal Reserve Board — were able to gain access to the full set of responses through a confidentiality agreement. Of the 58 questions, they identified 13 as being relevant to DEI, including “People here are treated fairly regardless of their race,” and “This is a psychologically and emotionally healthy place to work.” They used these to compile a DEI score for each company in the data set.
The results were striking. A higher level of gender or ethnic diversity in the overall workforce showed only a modest correlation with DEI scores. Having a higher ratio of women or ethnic minorities on the board had no positive correlation at all with DEI scores, and even showed some signs of negative correlation — possibly reflecting a superficial approach to this issue by some companies, according to Edmans. “You can always just expand the board to add a token person,” he told me.
So what did help? Having a higher proportion of women in executive roles was clearly associated with higher DEI scores in this study — perhaps because of the message this representation can send to employees, or because women are “more attuned” to related issues, the researchers suggested. (No such effect was seen with greater racial diversity in management — perhaps because even more enlightened companies had yet to reach “critical mass” on this front, with their management still tending to be overwhelmingly white, Edmans said.)
Smaller companies outperformed larger ones, probably helped by managers’ greater proximity to workers. And there were some clear sectoral trends: banking, energy and construction scored far above the confectionery and automotive industries, for example.
Beyond achieving better gender balance in management roles, companies might find the report light on actionable tips. But it does suggest that businesses that make serious progress on this front could reap financial rewards: DEI scores showed a positive relationship with both sales and profit growth. That tallies with work done by Dan Ariely at Duke University, which we featured in January, showing a strong correlation between employee motivation and stock returns.
And for all the flaws of the current approach to equity and inclusion, Edmans et al say it does seem to be bearing some fruit: the average DEI score from their calculations has risen from 4.1 out of 5 in 2006 to 4.35 in 2021. But if companies are serious about going further, the authors warn, they will need to do more than “add diversity and stir”. (Simon Mundy)
Banque de France governor François Villeroy de Galhau’s recent speech on the macroeconomics of climate change is well worth a read. The bank is narrowing its time horizons to focus on “short-term supply shocks”, such as natural disasters or a sudden rise in carbon prices.
In the Harvard Business Review, Ken Pucker of Tufts University takes a contrarian line on Vanguard’s exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. Vanguard is at least being open about its position, Pucker argues — unlike rivals who remain in the green coalition while failing to take climate issues seriously.

Russia’s economic war with the west moves to a new frontline,European companies,"The writer is a non-resident scholar at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, visiting fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations and research fellow at the Centre for East European and International Studies
Russia’s economic confrontation with the west following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine is entering a dangerous new stage. Until now, Moscow had mostly focused its retaliatory measures on squeezing European energy markets. But after a string of court decisions in Europe freezing Russian assets there, the Kremlin has begun escalation and created a legal framework for the temporary nationalisation of foreign assets in the country.
Projects that have cost billions of dollars and taken years of hard work are at stake, and it is likely the Russian government will exercise a personalised approach to every foreign stakeholder, trying to stoke new divisions in the west while benefiting interest groups inside Russia. The first victims of the new policy — the Russian assets of two European energy firms, Finland’s Fortum and Germany’s Uniper — were recently put under provisional management by a decree of Russian president Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin’s actions appear to have been triggered by the federal administrative court in Leipzig, which dismissed a claim by Rosneft, a state-owned Russian oil company headed by Igor Sechin, a longstanding Putin ally. Rosneft’s claim was against the German government and its decision in September to put the company’s assets in Germany under the supervision of the national energy regulator. Before that step, Rosneft was the third-largest oil refining company in Germany, accounting for more than 12 per cent of the country’s processing capacity.
Germany’s action stemmed from some of the unintended consequences of western sanctions. Rosneft’s refinery at Schwedt in north-eastern Germany is important to the economy of the greater Berlin area but, with its majority owner under sanctions as a shareholder, it couldn’t function properly: transactions involving sanctioned entities are illegal and there was a risk of capital withdrawal.
In Moscow, such actions by European authorities are increasingly viewed as nothing short of daylight robbery, and the hard men in the Kremlin won’t simply sit back and watch. The new exit rules for western companies set up last month are just another part of Russia’s retaliation strategy: western firms can only sell their stakes in projects with Russian partners at a 50 per cent discount, and also must pay a “voluntary donation” to Russia’s war chest worth 5 to 10 per cent of the asset’s value.
Apart from the technocrats in the Russian government who still care about the legality of Moscow’s actions, the major driving force behind the mounting nationalisation campaign are the siloviki — that is to say, individuals with a security service, police or military background. These include people in the FSB, the prosecutor’s office and Sechin, who can be described as the conservative leader of the Kremlin’s&nbsp;siloviki&nbsp;faction and who is clearly dissatisfied with the Leipzig court’s ruling.
Putin’s decree gives the federal property management agency the right to control western assets hit by the need to stop operations in Russia. The agency’s task is to evaluate these assets and then to sell them to Russian buyers. In other words, the recent actions against Fortum and Uniper’s assets are simply a taste of things to come.
With its new legal mechanism, it’s unlikely that the Kremlin will employ a uniform approach to foreign investors. Instead, it will cut separate deals with investors depending on their connections in Russia. A good example is Putin’s permission for Novatek, a privately owned Russian gas producer with good connections in the Kremlin, to pay Shell more than $1bn for its stake in the Sakhalin-2 oil and gasfield. This approach provides an opportunity for the Kremlin to drive new wedges between states and companies in the west.
As a result, western companies may find themselves in limbo. In the west, they are under public pressure to sever ties with Russia, but sanctions forbid them from selling their stakes to the majority of Russian businesses. Meanwhile, complying with the requirements of the Russian government may lead to them being branded enablers of Putin’s war. Consequently, a growing number of such companies look increasingly likely to lose their investments in Russia entirely.
So far, neither Russia nor Europe has a comprehensive strategy on how to deal with the stranded assets. The breakdown of ties will almost certainly exacerbate the conflict as the Kremlin seeks ways to punish Europe for imposing sanctions and supporting Ukraine. The appetite of Putin’s cronies to seize western assets in Russia will only add insult to injury."
Germany’s Dax stock market powers to record high,European equities,"Germany’s Dax index rose to a record intraday high on Friday as growing investor confidence in corporate earnings made it Europe’s second-best-performing main equity market this year.The index, a measure of Germany’s 40 biggest listed companies, added 0.9 per cent to more than 16,320, surpassing its previous high of 16,290 set in November 2021.
Shares in Adidas and Siemens are up almost a quarter this year as investors have warmed to stronger than expected corporate earnings, enabling the market to shrug off concerns that Europe’s largest economy is on the cusp of recession.
The Dax has returned 17.2 per cent this year including dividends, marginally behind the 18 per cent for France’s Cac 40 but well ahead of the 6.2 per cent return from the FTSE 100, according to data from Bloomberg. Wall Street’s S&amp;P 500 has returned 10 per cent over the same period, largely driven by gains for a select band of technology stocks.
Strong earnings were “underpinning the resilience of the market” and encouraging some investors “to turn more optimistic about the outlook for [European] equities,” said analysts at Bank of America.
Agnès Belaisch, chief European strategist at the Barings Investment Institute, said low unemployment rates had made for relatively strong wage growth, “helping firms pass on a large part of cost increases to retail prices, protecting margins and delivering surprisingly resilient earnings reports”.
US markets dominated by glitzy technology stocks have greatly outperformed those in Europe over the past decade but that trend has reversed since September.
Companies such as Airbus and Mercedes-Benz have risen 13 per cent and 12 per cent respectively this year as the manufacturing-heavy Dax has benefited from cooling energy prices and China’s economic reopening.
However, these and other positive catalysts had now “largely played out”, said analysts at Barclays, who flagged China’s “faltering” recovery and tighter credit conditions in the months ahead as key concerns.
“There is certainly not a fantastic, rosy macroeconomic picture emerging [for the Dax], said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at Dutch bank ING. “Certain financial markets are living a life of their own and have become slightly decoupled from the gloomy macroeconomic backdrop, which is in no way supportive of record high stock markets.”
The Dax hit its record-high shortly after the latest Zew indicator — a measure of investor sentiment — in May fell into negative territory for the first time since December, dipping 14.8 points to minus 10.7. Renewed weakness in the survey “points to weaker equity markets ahead”, said European equity analysts at Morgan Stanley.
German industrial production fell 3.4 per cent in March compared with the previous month, the biggest drop for 12 months, according to data released last week by the federal statistical office.
Eurozone inflation increased for the first time in six months to 7 per cent in the year to April despite the ECB’s aggressive monetary tightening campaign. “But we still have&nbsp;negative real interest rates, meaning there are no other alternatives to stocks”, Brzeski said."
The Greek MEGACYCLE,Eurozone economy,"Greece’s transformation from economic basket case to European growth tiger has been quite something to behold for anyone whose nightmares still feature Yanis Varoufakis playing the piano.
Earlier this week MainFT wrote about Greece’s turnaround, which has taken it from the world’s biggest debt default in 2012 to the cusp of an investment grade credit rating. Even The Economist is now calling it a European success story.
Not to be outdone by the media, Barclays analysts today published a big report on Greece arguing that it is on the verge of a “third economic megacycle”, irrespective of who wins next week’s general election:
Greece is not a typical economy that goes through 7-8 year cycles, at least not in a way that is impactful for observers outside Greece and investors. Instead, its post-WW2 economic history has been marked by two megacycles, deeply linked to structural forces and political choices.
Here’s Barclays’ telling of the broad brushes of Greek economic history since WWII, and its reasoning behind predicting another golden era:
The first megacycle . ..
The first megacycle took place between the 1950s and the mid-1970s. In 1950, Greece was coming out of its bloodiest decade in history. What with World War 2, an interwar famine and a protracted deadly post-war civil conflict, Greece lost one of the largest shares of its population during the 1940s globally.
In the aftermath, the Greek economy was devastated. In the months before the civil war had even started, former US Emissary to Greece Paul Porter wrote: “Today an almost forgotten American mission has got to perform a miracle . . . The miracle is to save Greece from economic disintegration . . . The whole country, from top to bottom is in the grip of a grey, unrelieved, profound lack of faith in the future . . .”. Even after the end of the civil war, Figure 1 shows that life expectancy in Greece was low — a result of economic strain and poor healthcare and sanitation conditions.
The arrival of foreign aid — mainly as a result of the Marshall Plan — coupled with protectionist industrial and foreign exchange policies, as well as foreign economic supervision, produced an economic miracle: Greece, albeit from a low base, posted years of growth rates seen mainly in rapid growth emerging economies of the time such as South Korea. It is estimated that Greece received a sum of $700mn, the sixth largest beneficiary of the ‘European Recovery Program’.
Greek living conditions had started to resemble those in modern western societies as early as the mid-1970s.
. . . then a protracted slump preceding the second megacycle
This first megacycle was followed by a protracted slump in activity, which lasted until the early 90s. Despite improved living conditions, politics were exceptionally unstable and democratic institutions frail. After the collapse of the Greek military dictatorship in the aftermath of the Cyprus crisis, Greek politicians decided to accelerate Greece’s EU entry, despite clear economic fragilities. The thinking was deeply political, as the EU was seen as a long-term anchor for democratic institutions (which indeed it became).
The lifting of industrial policies and protectionism (coupled with global oil and inflation shocks) led to a process widely known as ‘premature de-industrialisation’. The tradeable sector had grown mostly to attend the needs of the rapidly growing domestic economy and by no means was ready to compete in international markets. The combination of shocks led the traded sector into crisis — parts of it shrinking and other parts nationalised as part of a broader rescue plan.
Equally, however, this period laid the ground for Greece’s second megacycle. The arrival of structural funds from the EU, depreciation of the drachma, deep infrastructure investment and convergence policies soon led to the resumption of growth. Starting intermittently from the mid-80s but accelerating in earnest after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the Greek economy had grown more than five-fold as a share of the German economy by 2008.
At the end of this second megacycle, Greece had built substantial imbalances. Reliant on increasing amounts of government borrowing and external funding, operating at an uncompetitive cost level and consuming an unreasonable share of potential income, the economy was setting itself up for the 2010-2019 collapse, which is a relatively fresh market memory.
Again, as a share of the German economy, the Greek economy almost halved over a decade, including in nominal terms.
A potential third megacycle
Today, we think Greece has the opportunity for a third megacycle given three key dynamics:
1. Global services are becoming more tradeable, giving Greece a good chance to build an internationally competitive sector for the first time in its post-war history. Specifically, global trade in services are increasingly tradeable and are outperforming goods in terms of global trade growth (particularly if we exclude the one-off COVID-19 boom in goods trading).
2. This trend accelerated during the years of the Greek crisis and Greece is now catching up to it. Services constitute a good 75-80% of GDP for Greece. Greece is hence much more likely to be competitive in its areas of comparative advantage (tourism, real estate, transportation, IT, clean energy, healthcare) than to build a new auto manufacturing industry.
3. The issues facing Europe as a whole (energy security, energy transition, protectionism from China and the US) are reducing the focus on intra-European budget frictions and introducing a new focus on cross-EU policies set to address the challenges ahead.
4. Greece is starting from a low level of activity (a large output gap), with much fewer imbalances than in the past, benefiting from structural reforms and infrastructure investment and in receipt of NGEU funds, which in their current form will be levered to reach up to €60bn — which is extremely large in the context of the size of the Greek economy (c.€200bn).
Can Greece capitalize on these dynamics, given its many institutional and cost disadvantages? . . . FDI in both manufacturing and services [have spiked] in the last two years. There is clearly a sense that Greece is directly investable to a greater extent than in its recent past, and certain big deals in the technology and payments sector are pointing that way. In consequence, there seems to be more than just COVID-related growth base effects in Greece’s rapid post-pandemic recovery. Sustaining this momentum will be key to entering yet another multi-year high-growth megacycle.
The incumbent government should also be credited for this surge in investment — market confidence is a sign of investor-friendly policies. It is thus no accident that many rating agencies are waiting for the election result and its implications for political stability and reform momentum before a critical potential upgrade to investment grade.
As we discuss below, the election is not risk free, but we believe the risks are not too likely nor unmanageable. Overall, we still see Greek convergence to other highly rated peripheral bond markets (eg, Portugal) as a key investment thesis for 2023.
At this point a lot of people often point out (not unreasonably) that a bounce for Greece’s economy after getting annihilated for the better part of a decade is nothing to celebrate. Incomes remain far below where they were in 2010, and life expectancy has fallen.
But tbqh 2010 is arguably a fake starting point.
Not to relitigate old debates, but is there is no plausible, real-world scenario where the consequences of Greece’s economic, political and financial decisions leading up to that point (and many afterwards) wouldn’t have been painful anyway.
For now, let’s just be happy that Greece appears to be on the mend?

BlackRock spies rapid growth in European retail ETF market,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
A “new generation of European investors” are increasingly investing in exchange traded funds, according to new research from BlackRock.
A YouGov survey commissioned by the world’s largest asset manager, incorporating more than 16,500 retail investors in 14 European countries, suggested that investors aged between 18 and 34 were likely to replace those aged 35-plus as the dominant group of retail ETF investors.
The number of ETF investors in Europe is likely to rise 32 per cent over the next 12 months, suggested the poll, which was conducted between August 2022 and February this year.
Jane Sloan, head of iShares and index investments for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at BlackRock, said the US fund house expected 18 to 34-year-olds to represent 54 per cent of new ETF investors over the course of the year, 41 per cent of which will be first-time investors.
This article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.
By comparison, those aged 35 to 54 are expected to account for only 32 per cent of future ETF investors.
Sloan said these novice investors had typically become acquainted with ETFs via digital investment platforms and value the ease of investing and lower costs.
The poll suggested that ETF adoption by retail investors was likely to rise fastest in Spain and Portugal, two markets with low ETF penetration levels, where the number of ETF investors is forecast to increase 64 per cent.
In Germany, which already has the largest number of retail ETF investors in Europe, a further 2mn people are likely to invest in ETFs for the first time in the coming 12 months, pushing numbers up by 22 per cent.

BlackRock forecast that the number of retail ETF investors in the UK would rise 56 per cent over the same period, outstripping growth of 42 per cent in France, Belgium and the Netherlands and 39 per cent in Italy.
It said the benefits of ETFs included easy and cost-effective access due to low fees and minimum investments.
In Germany, BlackRock attributed the rapid adoption of ETFs to the development of online investment platforms and the growing popularity of ETF-based savings plans.
Last year it raised its growth forecast for ETF-based savings plans in Germany, forecasting that the number of such products would rise above 9mn, rather than 7mn, by 2025.

Corporate bond ETFs return to favour,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Corporate bond funds bounced back into favour last month as investors appeared to put fears of a mushrooming banking crisis behind them.
Investors had pulled money from corporate bond exchange traded funds for a second straight month in March, even as government bond ETFs sucked in a record $34.9bn, as savers sought refuge from the banking turmoil that had engulfed Credit Suisse and a string of regional US banks.
However, April flows seem to indicate that investors have sounded the all-clear, even as regional US bank stocks continue to trade at depressed levels.
In a dramatic reversal of risk appetite, net inflows to corporate bond ETFs surged to a healthy $9.1bn in April, according to data from BlackRock, cancelling out the prior two months’ outflows. However, net buying of government bond ETFs slid to just $7.7bn, the second-lowest figure since January 2022.
“A lot of credit exposures saw more buying, so the asset mix shifted [from a safe haven play],” said Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for BlackRock’s iShares arm in the Emea region.
In particular, Chedid noted a trend towards European investors snapping up European investment grade bond funds, a trade that is in line with BlackRock’s house view that old-world bonds now offer greater value than new-world paper.
The re-risking trend was also evident in the US, the epicentre of the banking crisis.
“In April, US investors were more willing to take on credit risk using fixed income ETFs due to greater confidence in the global economy,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at consultancy VettaFi.
In particular, Rosenbluth noted that the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) took in $2.7bn and $2.6bn respectively in April, while short-term Treasury ETFs such as the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-bill ETF (BIL) and iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY) incurred redemptions.
The latter was perhaps unsurprising, given that US investors were in the vanguard of waning appetite for government bonds, with net flows to US-domiciled sovereign bond ETFs plummeting from $28.7bn in March to just $2.6bn in April, compared to the more muted descent in their European-listed peers from $5.1bn to $3.7bn.
Rosenbluth also said there were signs of US investors starting to look overseas for higher-yielding instruments, with the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond (EMB) drawing in a net $420mn.
Chedid noted this trend across a range of asset classes. “US investors definitely have more of an international focus, buying more Europe, emerging markets everything,” he said
Chedid believed this cross-border focus was partially driven by the weaker US dollar. In addition, “Europe’s economy has done better than expected”, he said, although he believed both the eurozone and the US are still “headed for a recession”.
In particular, he noted that US investors allocated more money to European equity ETFs for the third month in the past four, a surprise, given that such flows “have not tended to be sticky” in the past.
Chedid attributed the flows to European stocks’ outperformance of their US peers, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 12 per cent since the start of September, three times the gain of the S&amp;P 500.
“Europe has been outperforming the US since September, and it’s very rare for Europe to outperform for so long,” he added.
Overall, global flows to equity ETFs held steady at $26.5bn in April, from $26.1bn in March.
Rosenbluth noted that the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO) attracted $2.9bn of this, something he attributed to “renewed confidence that the corporate earnings season would be relatively strong”.
In Europe, funds investing in line with so-called “environmental, social and governance” principles topped the charts, with the Xtrackers MSCI AC World ESG Screened UCITS ETF (XMAW) and Xtrackers MSCI World ESG UCITS ETF (XZW0) gathering $600mn and $473mn respectively, according to data from TrackInsight.
Net flows to ETFs in total dipped, though, from $65.1bn to $53bn, driven by fixed income’s share slipping from $37.7bn to $25.2bn and flows to commodity funds flatlining after hitting $1.6bn a month earlier.

Investors’ insouciance about the banking backdrop also shone through at the sector level. Not only did ETFs investing in financial stocks sport their fourth straight month of inflows — of $1.3bn — but US exposures led the way, seizing pole position from European financials.
Rosenbluth noted that the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) added just over $650mn of new money in April.
“The ETF provides some diversification with a mix of large-cap banks, insurance companies and capital market firms,” he said.
“There are investors out there buying the banks,” said Chedid. “There is a sense we have turned the corner on this, ie it’s not systemic, not that there can’t be more [bad] headlines.”"
Corporate culture ETFs aim to gain from happier employees,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
The claim that a company’s best assets are its people has now been built into investment strategies powering three exchange traded funds that seek to profit from the undervaluation of an employee-friendly corporate culture.
Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioural economics at Duke University who helped to build the strategies used by Harbor Capital for its ETFs, argues that companies that “do the right thing” in creating a culture where employees feel genuinely valued and motivated enjoy an improvement in their financial performance and share price.
“Happy and motivated employees can generate better outcomes for companies and investors,” said Ariely.
The theory also holds that scandals — such as that currently engulfing the CBI, a vocal advocate for best practice standards in the workplace now embroiled in allegations of a toxic workplace culture — destroy value.
Workers’ views of their companies are scored across seven categories to create a Human Capital rating by Irrational Capital, the investment research boutique co-founded by Ariely and David van Adelsberg, a former fund management executive.
The data to construct each rating is drawn from a proprietary database and public websites, such as Glassdoor, where employees review their former employers. No financial data is used in the ratings.
Ariely said the strongest share price signals were derived from harder-to-measure metrics such as employees’ perceptions of autonomy, fairness, trust, alignment of interests and psychological safety. More easily measured metrics such as job titles and benefits provide weaker performance signals.
Amin Rajan, chief executive of the consultancy Create Research, said investors were paying more attention to the wider social aspects of company behaviour as the investment appeal of a business could be damaged by the spread of less secure employee conditions.&nbsp;
“The gig economy, which has no paid sick leave, healthcare or retirement benefits, shows how socially undesirable job practices have acquired a cloak of legitimacy&nbsp;and undermined the long-held social contract between employers and employees,” said Rajan.
It is a leap to assume that companies with a strong corporate culture will continue to outperform once that pricing anomaly has been identified
Kristof Gleich, Harbor Capital’s chief investment officer, said current accounting rules did not always capture the value of a company’s investment in its brand, research and development, or its people.
“It has become a cliché for business leaders to say that ‘our people are our best asset’. But it is also true as we live in a knowledge economy,” said Gleich, who previously worked in manager selection teams at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
The Harbor Corporate Culture ETF (HAPI), is a modified market capitalisation weighted portfolio of about 150 US companies which has delivered a 19 per cent total return since it was launched in October 2022. HAPI has accumulated $240mn in assets which are almost entirely held by the&nbsp;$143bn State of Wisconsin Investment Board that oversees the investment assets of the public pension plans in the midwestern state.
Harbor Capital also offers a Corporate Culture Leaders ETF (HAPY), which tracks an equally weighted index of 70 to 100 US companies with a market value of at least $1bn that have the best Human Capital scores. It has gathered just $10mn in assets and returned a slightly disappointing -8.5 per cent since it was launched in February 2022, against -4.4 per cent over the same period for SPY, the largest ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500.
The third Harbor Capital ETF based on Irrational Capital’s work was launched just last month and has $91mn in assets. It tracks a market capitalisation weighted index of about 200 US smaller companies and is known as HAPS.&nbsp;
“New investment factors don’t come along very often. Human capital felt like the missing piece of a jigsaw,” said Gleich.
Despite the divergent returns from the ETFs in Harbor Capital’s corporate culture offering, JPMorgan’s quantitative analysts have also identified Irrational Capital’s work as a potential source of alpha — market beating returns.
“The Human Capital Factor exhibits noteworthy long-term outperformance versus the [US equity] market,” wrote Ayub Hanif, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note in November.
Ariely said Irrational Capital was working with the bank to develop a corporate culture strategy tailored to fit the needs of insurance companies.

However, Greg Davies, head of behavioural finance at the consultancy Oxford Risk, a consultancy, said that while it made sense for investors to understand corporate culture to help them identify well run companies, this was no guarantee of future share price outperformance.
“Companies with a strong corporate culture should actually present less risk for investors,” said Davies. However, he also cautioned that strategies built on back-tested data did not always meet investors’ expectations after they started trading.&nbsp;
“It is a leap to assume that companies with a strong corporate culture will continue to outperform once that pricing anomaly has been identified. We have seen other examples where arbitrage opportunities disappear rapidly after attracting a lot of new money,” he said."
ESG fund downgrades in Europe look set to reverse,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Just months after swaths of downgrades of “sustainable” investment funds in Europe, the industry is braced for mass upgrades, analysts say, risking a new wave of greenwashing accusations.
The reclassification from “light green” Article 8 funds to their “darker green” Article 9 counterparts is expected as a result of a clarification issued by the European Commission in April.
Some of the funds that will move up will be among those that were only recently downgraded under the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) classifications.
More than 300 Article 9 funds were downgraded to Article 8 in the fourth quarter of 2022, with a combined assets under management of €170bn, according to Morningstar data. And the trend continued into 2023, with €99bn of ESG funds downgraded to Article 8 in the first month of the year.
“Investors will now have to do more due diligence to understand the methodologies used. Investors may also be confused by the flip-flopping we’re likely to see over fund classification,” said Hortense Bioy, global director of sustainability research at data provider Morningstar.
The forecast confusion is due to contradictory messaging from the EU. Guidance issued last summer led fund managers to conclude that they would be held to minimum standards under the SFDR disclosure rules, but the clarification recommends a discretionary approach allowing fund managers to define by themselves what they mean by sustainable, or environmental, social and governance standards.
The flip-flopping is expected to start at the beginning of this month, according to Emil Stigsgaard Fuglsang, co-founder of Matter, an ESG consultancy and data provider.
“There have already been indications from the market that the recent Q&amp;A [clarification] from the European Commission will usher in a wave of reclassifications from ETFs employing passive strategies tracking Paris-aligned and climate-transition benchmarks,” Fuglsang explained.
Fuglsang believes the new guidance from the Commission will actually add to existing confusion highlighted in research that has just been published by Matter, which calls on regulators to acknowledge different sustainability objectives.
Matter examined the 20 largest Article 9 exchange traded funds, the 20 largest Article 8 ETFs that had just downgraded from being Article 9, and the 20 largest pre-existing Article 8 ETFs.
It found that the newly downgraded and pre-existing Article 8 ETFs had similar environmental impacts, which means that last year’s re-rating might have served to ease investor confusion over what they were buying if a fund was classified as Article 8.
However, it also found that the Article 9 funds, with their more specialised solutions-focused approach, risked disappointing investors. Specifically, Article 9 ETFs performed worse on average on the majority of EU Principle Adverse Impacts disclosures — which require reporting of negative effects on sustainability. Similarly, Article 9 ETFs expose investors to greater levels of UN sustainable development goal misalignment than their counterparts.

It is uncertain how many funds will move back up, but Bioy noted that, due to investor appetite for the more virtuous sounding “darker green” category, there were commercial incentives.
That could add to the problems highlighted in the Matter research, which found that three different approaches dominated the sustainable ETF landscape — broad ESG, Paris-aligned (committed to the transition to net zero) and thematic (such as clean energy).
“The combination of muddied waters between funds employing different approaches to sustainability, along with a largely discretionary approach to what can be considered ‘sustainable investments’, means that SFDR remains limited in terms of the clarity it offers, and will remain vulnerable to the same accusations of greenwashing that have faced it to date,” the report says.
“There is a need for a middle ground which accounts for and delineates between the diverse routes necessary to reach a sustainable future.”

Fund groups race to launch first US ether futures ETF,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Five ETF issuers filed to launch ether futures ETFs last week, in what could become a “winner-take-most” scenario, analysts say.
Grayscale was the first issuer to act, filing on May 9 to launch the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, based on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin.
Direxion, Roundhill Investments and Bitwise followed on May 10 with their own versions, filings show, while Valkyrie lodged an application on May 12.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved any ether futures ETFs. At least one firm — Kelly Strategic Management — filed for an ETF that would have invested in ether futures. Soon after, however, the firm withdrew its application.
The SEC, however, has given the green light to ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures. The now-$928mn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the first to launch in October 2021.
This article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.
The SEC has rejected bids for physical bitcoin ETFs due to the potential for fraud and manipulation. SEC chair Gary Gensler has called bitcoin a “Wild West” market that leaves investors less protected than stock and bond markets.
If approved by the SEC, the five ETFs will invest primarily in ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the filings show.
Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, a “decentralised network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols”, Grayscale’s filing notes. The funds will not invest directly in ether or any digital assets.
The five ETFs’ investment strategies are largely the same, prospectuses show. They will invest in wholly owned subsidiaries organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
Representatives from the issuers did not respond to requests for comment.
“No news is good news for bitcoin futures ETFs, and it’s a good sign for the prospect of futures-based ether ETFs, as well,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. “There isn’t any evidence that bitcoin ETFs were a failed experiment for the SEC, so this may be the right time for these funds to be approved.”
Shortly after it launched, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF amassed $1bn in assets at a faster pace than any previously launched ETF. However, its net asset value plunged 63.7 per cent in 2022. Since its inception, market depreciation has erased $1.3bn in investor assets.
Other bitcoin futures ETFs, such as ones from VanEck and Valkyrie, have struggled to keep up. The VanEck ETF has just $41mn in assets and Valkyrie’s has $30mn, respectively, according to FactSet data.
There was a “good case” for the SEC to approve the ether futures ETFs for the same reason that they approved the bitcoin futures ETFs in the first place, noted Matt Apkarian, associate director for product development at Cerulli Associates.
“The fact that these are digital asset futures doesn’t really change what the SEC needs to see relative to any other futures-based exchange-traded products,” Apkarian said.
Grayscale might also be calling the SEC’s bluff in regard to its statements in favour of futures-based crypto ETFs, Armour noted.
In June Grayscale sued the SEC after the regulator rejected its bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm claimed in the lawsuit that the SEC had no grounds to reject a spot bitcoin ETF after approving futures ETFs. The suit is ongoing.

The “rest of the pack” might just be jumping in line, in case the SEC approved these ETFs, rather than signalling increased optimism that they would be given the go-ahead, Armour said.
Roundhill and Direxion do not currently offer any crypto-related products. Bitwise, meanwhile, runs a $477mn 10 Crypto Index Fund and $70mn Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which invests in companies that derive most of their revenue from the crypto ecosystem, not crypto directly.
In March, Bitwise launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), a futures ETF designed for long-term investors.
“I wouldn’t be surprised to see this become somewhat of a winner-take-most scenario like we saw with BITO,” Apkarian said, referring to ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. “I think the first-mover advantage is likely why we are seeing so many firms trying to launch so quickly right now.”

Grayscale aims for possible loophole with new bitcoin ETF filing,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Grayscale, manager of the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund, has long been stymied by regulators in its bid to convert its flagship vehicle into an exchange traded fund.
However, it may have found a ruse to partially circumvent the restrictions imposed by the US Securities and Exchange commission.
Grayscale has filed to launch a US-listed ETF that would partly invest in so-called “spot” bitcoin exchange traded products already up and running in other countries.
These ETPs invest directly in “physical” bitcoin, or track the cryptocurrency’s price synthetically — structures the SEC has so far not permitted.
Instead, the SEC has only allowed bitcoin ETFs that trade in futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is a regulated venue.
This stance has prompted Grayscale to sue the SEC for its refusal to allow the $16.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private spot bitcoin trust, to convert to an ETF. A ruling is due by the end of the third quarter.
In the interim, though, Grayscale has filed to launch a Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which would invest 40 per cent of its assets in spot bitcoin ETPs listed on “major non-US exchanges”, such as in Canada or Europe.
While there is no guarantee that the application will be approved, analysts believe it has a chance given that the overseas ETPs Grayscale is proposing to invest in are regulated securities — precisely the type of asset that the SEC has insisted crypto ETFs hold.
“Grayscale’s filing seems intended to push the envelope with the SEC by using the SEC’s own words against it to launch crypto ETFs,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar.
“This seems like Grayscale is directly challenging the SEC’s past decision to allow bitcoin futures ETFs on one hand and on the other hand reject spot bitcoin ETFs,” he added.
Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, described the filing “as a creative way of Grayscale trying to offer US-listed product with some spot bitcoin exposure”.
“I think there is greater likelihood of Grayscale getting approval for this ETF than it getting the SEC to voluntarily approve a US-listed spot bitcoin only ETF, which is what Grayscale wants,” he added.
Rosenbluth believed the filing was an “acceptance of the reality that the SEC is not going to give [Grayscale] the green light”, to convert GBTC.
One point in Grayscale’s favour in its latest filing is that vast numbers of US-listed ETFs already hold regulated, non-US securities, mostly in the form of equities and bonds.
Indeed, at least one US ETF already holds foreign-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, appearing to set something of a precedent for the structure.
The $447mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) has positions in four Toronto-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, although they currently account for just 4.3 per cent of its portfolio, with the balance in stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology.
Grayscale is proposing that its 40 per cent exposure to spot bitcoin ETFs would be weighted equally between five underlying funds.
Rosenbluth also noted the “added irony” of Cathie Wood’s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) having a 6.8 per cent exposure to Grayscale’s GBTC trust, even though the SEC deems GBTC’s structure to be unsuitable for an ETF. The SEC declined to comment.
Even if Grayscale was to get approval for the Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, it is far from certain there would be a huge appetite for the fund, however.
It is proposing that the remaining 60 per cent of the portfolio would be invested in the equity of bitcoin mining companies. Armour was unconvinced there was much demand for such a structure.
“I don’t think investors benefit from access to a 60/40 portfolio of bitcoin miners and a global spot bitcoin fund of funds sleeve,” he said.
“The portfolio is confusing and will do a worse job tracking the spot bitcoin price than a bitcoin futures ETF, so I’m not sure this type of product adds any value aside from parsing out the SEC’s strategy for approving bitcoin-related ETFs.”
Rosenbluth agreed demand might be lacking, saying “combining bitcoin with other investments is not novel but has had limited interest”.
As evidence he cited the Global X Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which invests in the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and bitcoin futures, but which holds just $11mn.&nbsp;
Rosenbluth noted that despite a strong bounce for bitcoin and crypto-related companies after last year’s sharp losses, with the currency itself up 61 per cent so far this year, “demand for ETFs exposed to bitcoin has been limited”.

“Investors seem sceptical the rally can persist and remember the challenges of 2022,” he added.
For instance, although the $1bn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the largest bitcoin futures ETF, was up 57 per cent year to date as of May 12, it had only seen net inflows of $95mn, according to VettaFI’s data. This was not far ahead of the $75mn attracted by the $120mn ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF Strategy (BITI), which takes the opposite bet and is down 44 per cent year to date.
BKCH has returned 69 per cent so far this year but has seen net outflows of $2mn. Likewise the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) is up 68 per cent “and has seen no investor interest either”, Rosenbluth added.
Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale, was more bullish, however, arguing that “there is no question, coming out of the crypto winter, that investors’ appetite for crypto remains healthy. It has certainly not gone unnoticed by the crypto community that crypto has achieved some of the highest returns in 2023 to date.”"
Meteoric rise in power of ‘finfluencers’ sparks concerns,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
A jump in self-directed investing has been partly propelled by a surge in the sway of financial influencers, research shows, but how are investors to tell if they are getting bad advice from social media?
This question is already beginning to vex regulators. In August last year the US Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investor alert about social media and investment fraud, while the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning last month to “finfluencers” themselves on the risks of promoting illegal get-rich-quick schemes.
“I don’t think there is a way [to tell good finfluencers from bad ones]. People say bad things about good people and good things about bad people,” said Kevin Paffrath, a finfluencer who is known as Meet Kevin, to his 1.87mn subscribers on YouTube, and who has launched his very own exchange traded fund.
Paffrath himself is a case in point. Shortly after the MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF (PP) launched in December last year, Paffrath became unexpectedly embroiled in the scandal surrounding the collapse of crypto trading platform FTX.
Paffrath said he earned $289,000 from FTX endorsements. “We wish we had never worked with them in hindsight — so much bad press and we had no idea, nor could we have,” he said.&nbsp;
He has been named as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against a group of YouTube influencers that promoted FTX.
However, Paffrath is unusual among finfluencers in that he has gained a number of financial qualifications, including one to act as a licensed financial adviser.
Unlike him, the quality that most financial influencers share is that they have no formal financial education at all.
This might seem odd, but it could be an unfortunate byproduct of strict rules on marketing and endorsements that apply across the world to asset managers and other finance professionals.
Regulators themselves have been trying to fill the education gap — the SEC’s National Financial Capability Month in April was the latest example — but such campaigns face a tough battle for investors’ attention.
A report from Performance Marketing World published in August last year estimated that financial influencers experienced an average 8 per cent annual growth rate in the number of followers in 2021 — double the 4 per cent growth for all other influencers.
Newer investment apps lean heavily on finfluencers to spread the word about their services. Adam Lees, head of marketing at InvestEngine, a UK investment app that offers only ETFs, said the company worked with about 80 partners, including YouTubers, bloggers and personal finance websites.
Lees said around 40 per cent of marketing was spent on influencers, such as Jubair Ahmed, a postdoctoral researcher in biomedical engineering at University College London. He earns a fee when viewers of his InvestEngine content click a link that leads to the investment app.
BlackRock has caught the attention of many in the asset management industry by involving a finfluencer in an innovative sponsorship marketing campaign. The set of videos features five rookie US basketball hopefuls at the NBA Draft — a selection process that draws a wide audience across US society.
The basketball players are “coached” by social media influencer Lauren Simmons, previously one of the youngest traders on Wall St, who introduces them to investment principles that might guide how they invest the sponsorship money they receive as part of the campaign.
“iShares Future Baller$ was deliberately conceived at the intersection point of investing and basketball to introduce young and new investors to the iShares brand,” said Monique Le, head of iShares direct investing and marketing for the Americas.
“Our research showed the sport is a key passion point for our target audience and the campaign allowed us to meet them where they are.”
The campaign videos have been viewed 192mn times, according to BlackRock.
BrokerChooser, a consultancy, has measured new account openings at 17 brokers used by investors in the US, Europe, UK and globally, selected for their size, longevity and transparency of data.
The brokers had about 43mn retail accounts in 2020, but that number had jumped 120 per cent to about 94mn by the end of 2021. Growth has slowed since the end of the pandemic. There were about 121mn retail accounts at the end of the first quarter this year.
Even more striking was the jump in executed trades at these brokers, which rose more than 300 per cent from 887mn in 2019 to 3.6bn in 2020 and peaked at 5bn in 2021 before dropping back during last year’s adverse market conditions.
If qualitative research from the UK’s FCA is anything to go by, that huge growth in retail accounts could point to an urgent need for better education.
The new group of self-directed investors it studied were more than twice as likely to use YouTube and social media for their information than those who have been investing for longer.
But how are investors to trust what they are viewing?

Ahmed is very conscious of potential conflicts of interest and warns of the risks that self-directed investors face in consuming social media content.
“If I became a full-time creator, I think that would be a conflict of interest,” he said, adding that he thought in such circumstances it would be hard to stay true to his audience.
He said one tip he could provide on how to avoid unethical content creators on social media would be to steer clear of anyone who tries to convey a sense of urgency.
A general thumb rule might also be to look for transparency on how creators make their money, he said.
But as Paffrath points out, there is little regulation on social media. “As soon as I mention my ETF: ‘Hey check out my ETF, it’s the Pricing Power ETF . . .’ Boom! it has to go to regulation. But until then I’m completely separate and nobody checks anything, which I think is bad. I mean, I try to do my best.”"
Q1 US sustainable fund sector sales wounded by one ETF,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Investors pulled $5.2bn from US sustainable mutual funds and ETFs in the first quarter — but if it were not for one iShares ETF, they would have been in net inflows, according to a Morningstar report.
The $14.2bn iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) leaked $6.5bn during the quarter, Morningstar data shows. In March, investors withdrew more than $5.4bn — more than one-third of the fund’s assets. Most of those net redemptions happened on March 20, when the fund recorded $3.9bn in redemptions, as reported. The redemptions spike could have been because BlackRock rebalanced its model portfolios, Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, told Ignites at the time.
Also on March 20, the $28.1bn iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF recorded $4.8bn in net inflows.
BlackRock offers more than 150 model portfolios, its website shows. ESGU is in more than 20 BlackRock models, according to Morningstar Direct.
This article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.
Sustainable funds were not immune to market downturns in the short run, but BlackRock expected “structural shifts” to benefit sustainable strategies over the long term, the company said.
BlackRock’s other 30 sustainable mutual funds and ETFs recorded a combined $6.6bn in net outflows during the quarter, according to Morningstar’s database. They had $51.4bn in net assets as of March 31.
BlackRock was also home to the best-selling sustainable fund of the quarter, the $4.4bn iShares ESG Aware MSCI EM ETF (ESGE), which gathered $477mn during the three-month period, according to Morningstar’s database.
Across firms, passive sustainable mutual funds and ETFs bled nearly $6.1bn during the first three months of 2023, Morningstar’s data shows. If not for the ESGU, passive funds would have ended the quarter with net inflows.
Actively managed sustainable funds, meanwhile, bounced back into positives sales after recording net outflows for three consecutive quarters, the report says. In all, they added $91mn during the three-month period, the data shows.

The funds’ muted inflows may be due to global macroeconomic pressures, including the ongoing energy crisis and anxiety around the possibility of a recession, Morningstar’s analysis suggests.
Sustainable bond funds collected roughly $500mn during the quarter, according to Morningstar. Most of the inflows went into two BlackRock funds. The $2.7bn iShares ESG Aware US Aggregate Bond ETF (EAGG), which added $420mn between January 1 and March 31, and the $989mn iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF (SUSC), which collected $159mn. Sustainable equity funds, meanwhile, bled $5.4bn during the period.
More broadly, mutual funds and ETFs added more than $17bn in net inflows during the quarter, according to Morningstar. Mutual funds leaked a collective $60.8bn during the quarter, and ETFs netted $78.1bn, the database shows."
Regulators get tough on crypto funds after FTX collapse,Exchange traded funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
Providers of crypto exchange traded funds are struggling to establish their products as viable investments, according to regulatory experts, as a crackdown on digital assets continues.
Crypto markets endured a year of acute turbulence in 2022 when the price of popular digital assets, such as bitcoin and ethereum, plummeted from record highs. These sudden falls plunged several once-prominent firms — including lending platform Celsius Network and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital — into bankruptcy.
An industry-wide crisis of confidence culminated in November, when crypto exchange FTX — which, at its height, represented a pillar of the industry — collapsed in a matter of days after a surge in customer withdrawals. The exchange’s failure sparked a renewed sense of urgency among financial regulators to crack down on crypto markets — a trend that, in turn, poses a challenge to the world of crypto ETFs.
Crypto ETFs aim to give retail investors exposure to changes in digital asset values, without the need to buy or hold them directly. Nevertheless, regulators increasingly worry that these investors need protection from volatile prices and security scares.
“We’re in the midst of a regulatory onslaught against crypto,” says John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement. “Every day, it seems like there’s a new lawsuit targeting the industry. The SEC is not going to stand idly by, especially when investors are at risk. Investors may not like the rules but, just like seatbelt laws, sometimes investors need protection from themselves.”
As the chief financial markets watchdog in the US, the SEC has issued a blitz of enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies, including lender Genesis and exchanges Gemini and Kraken. The commission is also at loggerheads with asset manager Grayscale, which is seeking approval from the regulator to turn its bitcoin trust into a spot ETF holding the cryptocurrency directly.
The SEC has been willing to approve crypto futures ETFs — funds that track futures contracts, which are based on crypto prices but traded on regulated futures exchanges. However, it has repeatedly stopped short of granting approval to ETFs proposing to hold cryptocurrencies themselves, arguing that they trade on largely unregulated platforms where market manipulation presents a persistent risk.
The challenge is on the industry to prove that crypto is a safe investment for Americans’ retirement accounts — and that’s a very high bar
“I doubt the commission is going to change its thinking, given that they’re suing a new crypto company every week,” argues Stephen Diehl, software engineer and critic of the crypto industry. “The challenge is on the industry to prove that crypto is a safe investment for Americans’ retirement accounts — and that’s a very high bar.”
But Grayscale has long argued there should be no distinction between spot and futures crypto ETFs, because futures ETFs in effect expose investors to the same crypto market that a spot crypto ETF would. The asset management firm sued the SEC after having its request to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF rejected. Grayscale claimed that the regulator’s decision was “arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory”.
“Where this lawsuit lands will likely define the landscape of cryptocurrency ETFs for years to come,” suggests Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at investment insights company Morningstar.
Despite the tumultuous year for crypto assets, ETFs giving exposure to them thrived for most of 2022. Investors poured more than $240mn into six US bitcoin futures ETFs during the first 11 months of 2022, with more than 80 per cent of those inflows from June onwards — precisely when crypto was thrust into an unprecedented crisis of confidence.
That trend has continued into this year. By the end of January, several crypto ETFs posted eye-popping performances, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF, which registered a 101 per cent return for the month.
Later, in March, several crypto ETFs posted one-week returns of roughly 30 per cent, including the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which delivered 36 per cent, according to data firm VettaFi.
Asset manager ProShares launched the Bitcoin Strategy ETF to great fanfare in late 2021 — when it amassed more than $1bn in its first week of trading. Its performance has, however, nosedived amid crypto’s market crunch.
In 2023, though, crypto ETFs have been buoyed by a recovery in prices. Bitcoin — the world’s flagship cryptocurrency — has risen above $28,000, a roughly 70 per cent increase from its $16,500 mark at the start of the year.
But, in spite of this rebound, direct crypto trading has been affected by fears surrounding the security of customer funds — lending credence to the notion that new crypto investors put off by the risks are pivoting to ETFs as a safer entry point to digital assets.
These fears were heightened by the collapse of FTX and have been perpetuated by several security issues in the decentralised finance space, including last month’s $197mn hack of decentralised finance protocol Euler Finance.
According to Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, a London-based financial services firm, ETFs retain their allure for those investors interested in cryptocurrencies but new to the asset class. “If you’re new to crypto, managing your own private key [to hold currencies directly] may be riskier than having an ETF in your trading account.”&nbsp;
“If someone wants exposure to bitcoin, using an ETF gives them a less efficient product but they’re paying for the convenience of not having to hold their own crypto,” notes Solot."
Executive pay and climate: can bonuses be used to reduce emissions?,Executive Pay,"The greening of Schneider Electric started in 2005. The French electrical equipment group announced it would review its “social and environment performance” and set up a “planet and society barometer”. In 2008 it even rebranded itself in lurid green.
“If you measure it, it happens,” Jean-Pascal Tricoire explained to Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in 2007, a year after taking over as chief executive.
Tricoire’s own pay packet also has an increasingly green tinge. In recent years, his bonuses and long-term share grants have been tied to goals based on the barometer or its successor programme — such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions — plus the group’s performance on environmental, social and governance measures across a range of external indices. In 2020, a fifth of Tricoire’s total incentive pay — some €1.6m, including the value of shares from his long-term incentive plan — was due to his efforts to hit such targets.
As climate change has advanced up the boardroom agenda, so, inexorably, it has started to find its way into the incentives of senior executives. That has raised questions, not only about the clarity and solidity of the underlying goals and the ease with which chief executives might hit them, but about the purpose and effectiveness of monetary rewards as a way of changing corporate behaviour.
For now absolute numbers of companies using climate targets to calculate chief executives’ bonuses and long-term incentives remain low: just 24 companies in the FTSE 100, and only 20 in the S&amp;P 500, according to ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. But from a low base, the number of companies using climate pay targets more than doubled between 2019 and 2020. A&nbsp;survey by Deloitte in September&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;a further 24 per cent&nbsp;of companies polled expected to link their long-term incentive plans for executives to net zero or climate measures over the next two years.
“We have not seen that sort of increase since TSR became the measure in vogue” in the early 2000s, says Phillippa O’Connor, a partner at PwC, who advises companies on executive rewards, referring to total shareholder return, the metric of choice for tying executives’ incentives to financial performance.
The push to integrate climate goals, and wider ESG targets, into pay plans has been led by consumer companies such as Unilever. Investors have also intensified the pressure on oil and gas groups such as Royal Dutch Shell to follow suit. According to ISS ESG, 39 per cent of energy companies in the world’s biggest indices had incorporated climate targets into their chief executives’ pay by last year, the highest proportion of any sector.
Harlan Zimmerman, senior partner at Cevian Capital, an activist investment group, sees the introduction of targeted pay as a “forcing mechanism” to change mindsets about climate change.
Others are more sceptical. Alex Edmans, a finance professor at London Business School (LBS), favours paying chief executives with shares that they must hold after they leave to nudge them to take decisions in the longer-term interests of the company. “When you [set specific goals], you get this problem of hitting the target but missing the point,” he says.
When earnings per share growth was popular as an executive goal, for instance, bonus-hunting managers tended to fixate on short-term expansion. Research also shows that when too many targets are added to incentive schemes, executives start to concentrate on the most obvious opportunities for reward — almost always financial growth, which carries the biggest weight in pay plans. Yet investors continue to add new items to their wishlist of targets.
Other studies have also suggested executives receive more generous payouts on non-financial targets than they do when judged on precise financial achievements, perhaps because they are often harder to measure and more subjective.
Climate targets also face an obvious snag not shared with shorter-term strategic goals. Companies’ environmental goals often have an understandably long horizon — 2030, 2040, or even 2050 — but chief executives’ tenure is much shorter. An S&amp;P 500 chief executive holds office, on average, for less than 10 years.
“Like everything to do with executive remuneration, it isn’t easy to get this right,” says Edward Mason of Generation Investment Management, the sustainability-focused fund company with $36bn of assets under management. “There are risks of perverse incentives and easy remuneration that investors should be on the lookout for.”
Climate actions linked to bonus: Reached goal of 80% renewable electricity, surpassed goal of 120m tonnes of carbon dioxide saved by customers by 2020
Bonus structure: 80% financial; 20% sustainability impact
Some red flags are already flapping, according to pay analysts and investors. One is a concentration on tactical, short-term targets, such as operational efficiency, rather than more strategic, long-term goals such as emissions reductions. A second danger signal is a focus mainly on vaguer discretionary measures of progress, such as “improving sustainability” sometimes mixed with other qualitative goals. A third is the lack of transparency.
“A lot of targets we are seeing are still quite vague,” says Tom Gosling, an executive fellow in the finance department&nbsp;at LBS, “and about ‘making progress towards [a goal]’, as opposed to pinning yourself to a final number.”
Honeywell, for instance, has committed to become carbon neutral by 2035 in its core activities, yet progress towards these commitments is not linked in detail to its executive pay plan. The US industrial group paid its chief executive Darius Adamczyk an annual bonus of $2.5m for 2020, of which 20 per cent was based on the remuneration committee’s assessment of a raft of goals including driving “a robust ESG programme”.
ASML, the Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment group whose shares are quoted on Nasdaq, has promised to cut its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations to zero by 2025 as part of the “climate and energy” criteria for executive bonuses. It benchmarks itself against other semiconductor companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. But it refuses to reveal actual targets and achievement levels, saying they are “commercially or strategically sensitive”. It is reviewing its policy following challenges from investors to improve transparency.
Angeli Benham, senior global ESG manager at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, which has $1.8tn of assets under management globally, is typical of many in calling for climate goals to be “meaningful, material, and measurable”.
The two largest elements of performance pay are the annual bonus, and long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which typically runs for three years.
The level of enthusiasm within boards to attach more conditions to their chief executives’ incentives varies. ISS ESG measured the highest impact of climate factors in pay at companies in the French and German benchmark indices, and the lowest in Asia and the US.

Not one of the attempts by US investors to tie executive pay to ESG measures attracted significant support at this year’s annual meetings, according to Glass Lewis, another proxy adviser. It registered a drop in shareholder support for ESG targets in pay to 12 per cent, on average, compared with 17 per cent last year and 22 per cent in 2019.
Glass Lewis itself recommended support for just one proposal this year: that General Motors should report if and how the carmaker had met pay criteria laid down by Climate Action 100+, a network of investor organisations. Lila Holzman, from the lobby group As You Sow, told GM’s board meeting that shareholders wanted chief executive Mary Barra and her team “to focus their actions on achieving Paris-aligned goals during these next critical years when it matters, not some day in the future”.
Her plea to embed climate change performance measures in executive pay fell on deaf ears.
Defending itself in the proxy statement issued to shareholders ahead of its annual meeting, GM said it had taken its sustainability performance into account in setting pay since 2017 and added that it had “highlighted our executives’ key 2020 ESG achievements” with a leaf symbol in its performance highlights. Even though Glass Lewis judged the GM proposal “not to be overly burdensome”, given the carmaker’s existing commitments to climate goals, it was rejected with only 16.3 per cent of GM shares voting in favour.
The GM case highlights that every company is different when it comes to tying climate targets to pay, making a blanket approach unworkable. But successfully adopting bespoke plans is arduous and complicated.
For instance, NatWest, the UK-based bank, has set conditions on its issue of stock to Alison Rose, chief executive, that include reducing carbon emissions from its direct operational footprint and increasing funding for clients’ climate and sustainable finance initiatives. Helen Cook, NatWest’s chief human resources officer, told a recent Deloitte webinar that introducing climate conditions into executive pay was “a new frontier”.
She said she and her team “probably had 10 iterations of conversations around climate before we got our first climate measures”. They had to revisit those at least twice after the bank’s remuneration committee had discussed them, “because people were trying to define and to discern what was measurable and importantly what is auditable”.
Advocates of linking climate targets to executive pay say, done well, it can pay off.
Dutch and UK investors have in recent years pushed Shell, for example, to clarify its path to carbon reduction. Before a Dutch court ordered the group to increase its emissions cuts in May — a decision against which Shell is appealing — the group had strengthened its pay policy in line with the aim of limiting rises in global average temperature to 1.5C. Chief executive Ben van Beurden’s annual bonus, for instance, will in future link to its greenhouse gas abatement target, and 20 per cent of his long-term incentive payout will be tied to Shell’s energy transition, up from 10 per cent in previous years.
Schneider Electric is another example. Its 2005 commitment to “spotlight” corporate responsibility had evolved by 2012 into formal ESG targets within chief executive Tricoire’s bonus and long-term share awards. The weighting of the sustainability targets in his annual bonus increased in recent years from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, and then in 2019 to 20 per cent, the same as for his long-term rewards. That helped to double the total value of incentives he received by working towards sustainability targets from €851,840 in 2018 to €1.6m in 2020.
During that time, the board responded to shareholder pressure by tying the long-term incentive plan’s sustainability targets to external measures and simplifying the number of criteria used overall. The group says it hit or surpassed two of its four climate targets set in 2018, en route to its overall aim of becoming carbon neutral in its operations by 2025.
Tricoire is receiving a higher overall payout partly because the portion attributed to non-financial measures has increased and because Schneider Electric’s shares have performed well. But in a sign of how difficult it was to meet those non-financial targets as they became more “meaningful, material, and measurable”, the rate at which he achieved those goals actually dropped.

Bonus structure: 75% financial; 25% strategic goals
Shell, Schneider Electric, Honeywell, General Motors, Unilever, NatWest, ASML: these are large companies that attract the attention of big institutional investors. As significant emitters, Unilever, GM and Shell are on Climate Action 100+’s list of “focus companies” that account for 80 per cent of global corporate industrial emissions and whose governance and executive pay policies will be closely monitored and scrutinised against their environmental commitments.
The danger, investors acknowledge, is that smaller companies, or companies for which climate change is less immediately significant, will reward their executives by implementing less rigorous programmes with easy-to-hit targets.
Benham, from LGIM, says she expects most smaller companies to take the lead from the improving practice of their larger counterparts, but she admits: “Our focus tends to be with the largest companies where we devote a lot more engagement time. So there may be a multitude of smaller companies that put anything in there and get away with it.”
A more fundamental criticism is that executive pay may not even be the right tool for encouraging this type of corporate change. Tax, regulation, and carbon pricing initiatives that can only come from governments, or, for that matter, high-profile court cases, could be more effective.
Investors argue, though, that challenges to executive rewards attract board attention.
US “say on pay” rules mandate a non-binding vote on remuneration. By using those rules to push for ESG targets in executive pay, investors say they can force the climate question on to the agenda of directors. Encouraging the incorporation of climate targets into senior executive pay also signals to more junior managers that it is important and trickles down to other staff. At Schneider Electric, 10 per cent of the bonus of all 58,000 staff has been tied to sustainability targets since 2019.
As for the criticism that traditional financial ambitions over-rule or contradict climate targets — which might, for instance, involve reducing output to cut emissions, Generation Investment Management’s Mason says: “Good management is about reconciling the short term and the long term and understanding where things run up against each other and finding a path through that.”
Gosling, of LBS, argues that if environmental measures — and, indeed, social and governance improvements — support longer-term shareholder value, there may be better ways to encourage executives than tweaking rewards. If, however, ESG initiatives conflict with long-term value, then “executive pay will never be the solution”.
“We’re kidding ourselves if we say we can solve a climate crisis without changing the economic guide rails for companies at all; I’m very sceptical about using executive pay to set climate targets that are sufficient,” he says. “We hope for far, far too much from this intervention.”

What could usefully happen in the UK’s ‘big tent’ conversation on pay,Executive Pay,"When Julia Hoggett, boss of the London Stock Exchange, asks for a “big tent” conversation on pay, with a broad, “constructive” look at whether the UK market needs to rethink how it remunerates top executives, I just think of a circus.
This debate has become something of a three-ring spectacle. The complaint is that UK investor attitudes to pay are preventing companies from attracting the best people. Investors are responding to client pressure and to government policy, through “say on pay” votes at shareholder meetings and requests for disclosure of pay ratios between bosses and workers. There isn’t a big top big enough to convince the general person or policymaker that an average pay packet of £4.3mn in the FTSE 100 is the root cause of what is holding the country back.
US pay does seem to have pulled ahead in recent years. But that’s in part because pay generally correlates with company size and the US is a bigger market and richer country. UK executive pay still compares favourably to Europe, according to Xavier Baeten at Vlerick Business School, although that is more true for the median CEO than the top performers. In the interests of being constructive, what discussion could usefully take place in Hoggett’s tent?
First, it could get out of the realm of anecdote. “Surprisingly, there’s not a readily available database that enables consistent comparisons of CEO pay in different countries, taking full account of factors like company size, the level of risk in the pay package, and significant differences in local tax and pension regimes,” said Tom Gosling, at London Business School. While we’re at it, how much influence do proxy firms really have in determining how shareholders vote? Estimates for how much of the vote they sway range from 10 to 40 per cent. Complaints about pay are longstanding so how and where is this a real problem for hiring now?&nbsp;
Second, is there really a one-size-fits-all solution? Some UK-listed companies genuinely play in a global market for top hires, but plenty don’t.
Take education group Pearson, which last week had 46 per cent of investors vote against its pay policy for US-based boss Andy Bird who came from Disney. The bulk of its business and employees are in the US, the company and stock are (finally) performing well. But proxy advisers objected to the policy based on UK comparisons and “quantum”, while similar sums are deemed fine stateside for smaller competitors. Hoggett’s complaint about double-standards is reasonable. Does addressing that issue inevitably spill over into higher pay for the entire market?
Third, there seems to be a problem with a tortuous process and not just the resulting numbers. Everyone complains that pay takes up too much time and dominates interactions between companies and their investors.
This is partly because investors want to show their workings. It owes something to a — somewhat justified — lack of faith that boards will push back against dominant bosses. It may also be because the typical UK pay model is complex and ill-suited to the company concerned. Efforts to offer simpler alternatives or more flexibility, for example through use of restricted stock, haven’t got far.
Fourth, the asset management industry needs to grapple with its own divisions. The idea of a sector torn between money managers and governance fanatics may be overblown: research from London Business School found the proportion of portfolio managers and governance experts that thought pay too high was remarkably similar, both north of 70 per cent. But there is obvious ill feeling and furious debate within the sector about how it handles pay issues, a boil that probably needs lancing.
Fifth, does rethinking pay chime with the “scrappy and hungry” market that Hoggett herself wants London to become? Boards should have to make the case for unusual packages, and take some investor dissent on the chin. Executives should have to earn their way into blockbuster numbers on the back of success, not on the promise of it. Both happened with Pascal Soriot at AstraZeneca — successfully, according to the chair this week. Higher pay for sluggish performance doesn’t fit with an entrepreneurial, upstart image.

Business schools target executives’ green gaps,Executive education,"When Shane McArdle studied finance and accounting at business school in the 1990s, there was little emphasis in the curriculum on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that have since risen high up the corporate agenda.
The chief financial officer of health and beauty retailer Boots Ireland, McArdle wanted to become its finance champion for sustainability, and to bridge the gap between sustainability and business language. So, to deepen his knowledge and skills, he felt he needed to go back to school — specifically, to enrol on a specialist executive education course. Earlier this year, he signed up for Insead’s business sustainability programme.
“Climate change wasn’t a huge point 25 years ago,” McArdle recalls. “The world has entirely changed. It’s a tidal wave of movement towards responsible capitalism and sustainability, from an investor perspective.”
On the five-day programme, in Fontainebleau, near Paris, he developed the tools to measure, assess, report and communicate on sustainability, while also building a network of peers. “I already had a good understanding of the ‘what’ that needed to change, but the programme gave me the ‘why’ and the ‘how’,” he explains.
McArdle’s experience underlines how executive education is playing an important role in bringing up to date those business leaders whose degree programmes paid little heed to sustainability. For several decades, the business-school syllabus was shaped by the shareholder-primacy doctrine. That is changing, as issues such as climate change, purpose and values increasingly feature in MBA and other business degree courses.
The shift in emphasis has left “a massive gap in understanding what role companies play in the world” among some alumni, says Tom Lyon, the Dow professor of sustainable science, technology and commerce at the Ross School of Business and the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan.
“People who graduated 20 to 30 years ago didn’t get the same training as people do today,” he says. “There really is some remedial education that’s needed.”
People who graduated 20 years ago didn’t get the same training — remedial education is needed
Where once business schools encountered tacit resistance from executives who viewed sustainability as a “softer” discipline, the appetite for such content is growing as companies have come under pressure to look beyond profit. Training providers are responding with new programmes that can help executives advance their organisation’s ESG initiatives.
Michigan: Ross will debut its new programme, “Building board expertise on sustainability”, in September. It targets directors of US corporations, who are facing competing forces. “On one hand, they have stakeholders who think companies are not doing enough for sustainability. The paradigm example is Engine No 1,” says Lyon. The hedge fund launched a proxy battle with ExxonMobil in 2021, nominating four directors to the oil company’s board and urging wholesale changes to its climate strategy.
“You also have lots of Republican politicians trying to punish companies that even think about ESG criteria, labelling them ‘woke capitalists’,” he adds. The new course will help boards understand their role in ESG oversight and present research that links sustainability with improved financial performance. It will also help directors speak out on contentious political and social issues.
The mantra of profit maximisation that once ruled on business-school syllabuses is often blamed for corporate wrongdoing. But, now, schools are keen to emphasise their role in training senior leaders who can powerfully shape corporate practice in positive ways.
“Executive education participants are the target group we want to motivate, because the decisions they make, the example they set, and the resources they allocate, can amplify the degree of change,” says Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at NUS Business School in Singapore.
Loh says sustainability is evolving so rapidly that many business leaders are taking executive courses to keep pace. When NUS launched its short programme, Sustainability: the Next Challenge, last year, it expected to run the course once or twice annually. But such is the demand that the course is already on its eighth intake of participants.
In addition to standalone courses, schools are weaving ESG factors into broader management programmes, in a holistic approach to training.
“It’s very difficult to talk about leadership without talking about sustainability,” says Russell Miller, director of learning solutions and innovation at Imperial College Business School in London. “You just cannot separate it out from these core subjects anymore.”
What’s more, those modules are no longer looked down upon, adds Frank Brueck, who runs the Leadership Lab at the Leonardo Centre on Business for Society at Imperial. “If you have that in a programme, it’s not frowned upon any more. People realise this is something they need.”
Schools say their role is now less about winning hearts and minds and more about helping executives formulate and execute a sustainability strategy. “Organisations have come to appreciate this is no longer a box that needs to be ticked: it’s of strategic importance,” says Sameer Hasija, the dean of executive education at Insead.
Sustainability is no longer a box that needs to be ticked: it’s of strategic importance
Business-school academics, he adds, are having to quickly update their subject matter. “These topics are at the cutting edge of our frontier of knowledge,” he says, citing the scramble to create reporting standards for sustainable business.
However, Stuart Robinson, associate dean for business engagement, innovation and professional education at the University of Exeter Business School, questions whether business schools have the expertise to teach complex subjects such as climate change.
The UK school uses climate scientists from the University of Exeter to deliver executive education programmes. “We don’t want to behave as activists, but as scientifically informed institutions,” he stresses.
The bigger question is whether the lessons delivered in the business classroom are making a tangible difference in how the corporate sector behaves. “We need to start seeing people’s changing level of knowledge having an effect on what businesses do,” says Robinson. “We’re early in this process, but this is the next stage.”"

Brokers braced for big overhaul of US stock trading rules,Financial & markets regulation,"Banks, trading firms and brokers are bracing for the biggest overhaul of US stock trading in almost two decades with the release on Wednesday of plans designed primarily to lower costs for small investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to vote on four proposals aimed at pushing brokers and market-making firms to execute deals at the best price available — and prove this was done.
Industry executives have described the reforms as the most sweeping since 2005, when a set of rules known as Regulation National Market System also addressed conditions for small investors by modernising US equity markets.
“Potentially these could be the most significant changes to the regulation of equity market structure since regulation NMS,” said Paul Mahoney, law professor at the University of Virginia.
After the meme-stock boom of 2021, when retail traders sent the prices of a handful of stocks into the stratosphere, SEC chair Gary Gensler this year revived debate about making further changes to market rules.
Last year’s trading frenzy highlighted the practice of “payment for order flow” where popular retail brokers such as Robinhood are paid to route customer orders to big trading companies including Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial.
So-called PFOF is banned in several other jurisdictions including the UK and Canada. Gensler has warned about the risks of conflicts of interest raised by PFOF, including brokers’ use of video game-like digital features to encourage customer trading.
“There’s been at least 20 conferences that I’ve attended over the past two years where [regulation] was the only topic people wanted to talk about,” said Anthony Denier, chief executive of retail broker Webull. “It’s been discussed so much by people on either side of the PFOF fence, we are looking forward to an actual proposal or for something to actually come forward.”
The SEC is not expected to block PFOF, but the proposals could significantly curtail its use in several ways. One item on Wednesday’s agenda would require brokers to auction customers’ orders. Another item would require them to publish detailed data showing how orders were carried out.
Thomas Peterffy, chair of Interactive Brokers, said: “There is a lot of talk about how execution quality is already as good as it can be. That is very possible, but it would be reassuring for the customer to really see that it is as good as it can be. ”
If the SEC’s five commissioners vote to propose the new requirements, they will undergo a public comment period before returning to the regulator for final approval and adoption. The plans are said to run for more than 1,000 pages, according to industry officials.
Big trading firms are expected to oppose the new auction requirement, having warned previously it could increase trading uncertainty and raise, not lower, costs for small investors.
One market maker said: “The proposals as they’ve been previewed are solutions in search of a problem. And that concern has been expressed by virtually every corner of the marketplace.”
Other rule changes on Wednesday’s agenda include cutting the price increment, or “tick size”, in which a stock can trade to less than a cent, and a new standard for “best execution”, which requires brokers to ensure they have found the best price, at that time, for their client’s trade.
Stock exchanges broadly support smaller tick sizes, which they believe would help exchanges compete with other venues that already offer sub-penny trading to big wholesale investors.
SEC commissioners are also scheduled to vote on a separate final rule that would require US corporate executives to wait four months to sell shares after establishing a so-called 10b5-1 plan, according to two people familiar with the rulemaking. Such plans allow company insiders to sell shares automatically without risk of violating insider trading rules.
The new rule would end a controversial practice in which executives sell stock days after creating a plan, raising suspicion that they may have acted with inside information.
A Financial Times investigation last year found Beijing-based Cheetah Mobile chief executive Sheng Fu sold $31mn of shares a few weeks before reporting disappointing quarterly earnings. In September 2022, the SEC charged Fu with insider trading, saying that he established a trading plan knowing a big drop in advertising revenues was about to be announced.
The SEC unanimously proposed the four-month waiting period a year ago, but now at least one Republican SEC commissioner is expected to vote against the final rule, person familiar with the matter said.

Global regulator calls for ‘urgent action’ on clearing houses and insurers,Financial & markets regulation,"The world’s most powerful group of global&nbsp;financial&nbsp;policymakers has called for “urgent work” to address gaping holes in regimes to deal with failing clearing houses and insurers whose operations stretch across borders.
The Financial Stability Board, comprising central bank governors and regulators from 24 major economies, issued their call to action days after the global convening&nbsp;body for central&nbsp;banks warned that risks in shadow banks could&nbsp;force more bailouts and fuel runaway inflation.
After a decade of low interest rates, global markets have been jolted this year by soaring consumer prices. Central banks are curbing asset purchases and aggressively raising rates, and authorities fear violent moves could be amplified in the non-bank financial sector, which has taken a greater share of market activity since the 2008 financial crisis.
Already this year the nickel market in London was forced to temporarily close and European energy companies bailed out, underscoring how sudden price moves in one asset can provoke a vicious loop of margin calls and forced sales elsewhere.
“As the 15-year anniversary of the global financial crisis is on the horizon in the coming year, it is critical to maintain momentum and avoid complacency,” the FSB said, noting that while the banking sector risks that triggered the 2008 crisis had been largely dealt with, other risks had not been tackled as comprehensively.
The FSB highlighted the work on clearing houses and insurers as the two most urgent areas in need of attention, although the scope of the work excluded other parts of the ballooning shadow banking sector such as funds and crypto, where policymakers have also noted the need for action.
The global body said there had been insufficient progress on the development of living wills — pre-made plans to wind down important financial entities — for clearing houses, which insulate the market from contagion if there is a default.Last month, the London Metal Exchange said it was forced into closing the nickel market in March to prevent surging nickel prices from blowing a hole in a stability fund that provides a layer of market protection, an event that could have cascaded across the financial system.
“The FSB has been considering the costs and benefits of potential alternative financial resources and tools for [clearing house] resolution, alongside a comparison to existing resources,” the FSB said on Thursday. “Several potential alternative financial resources and tools have been identified for further analysis, with a plan to consult on policy options in 2023.”
Though authorities in some jurisdictions have reported progress in planning how to wind down systemically important insurers, there is “still work to be done” to make these plans fully operational, the FSB said. It did flag the EU’s proposed resolution plan, unveiled last year, and changes expected in Australia, South Africa and Switzerland, but generally described “mixed progress”.
Aspects of these plans have proved controversial: consumer groups have raised concerns that Brussels’ proposals for how to deal with failing insurance firms could expose policyholders to losses.
The FSB said It would focus its work next year on identifying those “critical functions [at insurers] that need to be maintained in resolution and on exploring resolvability issues related to group and conglomerate structures”. Understanding “interconnectedness” within insurance groups was critical to an effective resolution plan, it said."
Regulator suspends fund manager Emerge Canada,Financial & markets regulation,"Regulators have suspended the registration of a Canadian fund manager that failed to file audited accounts on time and ordered it to wind up its exchange traded funds or transfer them to a different manager.
The move to suspend Toronto-based Emerge Canada, which billed itself as “Canada’s first and only woman-owned investment fund firm”, comes after the discovery of a highly unusual financial arrangement whereby Emerge Canada owes the ETFs approximately C$5.5mn ($4.1mn), according to the Ontario Securities Commission.
The regulator on Thursday suspended Emerge Canada for its failure to meet minimum working capital requirements of C$100,000, a failure it said has existed since at least September 2022.
A month ago the OSC imposed an “indefinite” trading ban on its 11 exchange traded funds after the failure to meet the March 31 filing deadline for financial statements.
The ETFs, which include six vehicles designed to replicate the performance of technology-focused funds managed by Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, had combined assets of C$109mn when they were hit by the trading ban, believed by industry experts to be unprecedented for an ETF anywhere in the world.
The OSC said Emerge Canada had been calculating its excess working capital by including a “related-party receivable” owed to it by Emerge Capital Management, also known as Emerge US, the sub-adviser to the ETFs, of C$3.4mn, as of March 31.
The OSC ruled this could not be counted as a current asset on its balance sheet because it is unable to realise this asset within 12 months as it is dependent upon the ability of Emerge US to pay the receivable, or money owed.
Even including this receivable, Emerge Canada’s working capital was just C$12,819 on September 30 last year, the regulator said. Moreover, the company’s investment account also included 1.5mn cryptocurrency tokens, which the OSC said should be written down by 100 per cent to reflect their inherent risk.
As a result, the regulator said Emerge Canada had a working capital deficit of C$4.5mn as of September 30.
According to the OSC, Emerge US’s attempts to raise the funds it needs to pay off the receivable have been fruitless. In February, Lisa Langley, chief executive of Emerge Canada, said Emerge US had secured a loan of US$5mn worth of short-term bonds from a UK company, United General OpCo Ltd, which Langley said would be “redeemed immediately to cash”.
The bonds turned out to be issued by the government of the small Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. Despite attempting to sell them since April 11, it has been unable to do so as “the bonds are traded over-the-counter and Emerge US needs to locate an institutional buyer”, the regulator said.
Emerge Canada said in a brief statement that it “is considering its next steps in light of this decision”. United General OpCo Ltd could not be immediately contacted for comment.
The OSC statement said Emerge Canada argued that suspending the firm and requiring the wind-up of the Emerge ETFs was overly punitive, unwarranted and not in the best interests of unit-holders, due to the outstanding debt, while “forcing a sale of the assets of the funds may occur at liquidation values.”
Emerge Canada said the suspension was also unwarranted because it was a relatively new company “and it fills a unique niche in the ETF market” as “North America’s first all-women investment team managing innovative and socially responsible investment strategies”.
Moreover, forced liquidation of the ETFs could cause “reputational damage” to other small ETF providers,” it argued.
However, Debra Foubert, director of the compliance and registrant regulation branch of the OSC, said that while she “applauded the fact that Emerge is breaking ground . . . the regulatory requirements apply equally to all registrants.
“Emerge Canada is in breach of Ontario securities law. It continues to be working capital deficient, and there is no timeline or certainty as to when Emerge Canada will bring itself into compliance.”"
US default would make Cyclone Roller Coaster ‘look like a kiddie ride’,Financial & markets regulation,"Yesterday the SEC’s chair Gary Gensler spoke at ISDA’s annual meeting in Chicago. The main topic was the regulator’s plans to overhaul the Treasury market, but he couldn’t resist having a pop at the debt ceiling idiocy.
Gensler highlighted how fears that a default could ensue were creeping into markets, and warned that if it actually happened it could be a cataclysmic event. From the prepared remarks:
While we at the SEC have no direct role in those discussions, the outcome is directly consequential to each part of our mission: protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
We’ve already seen an effect in the pricing and liquidity of short-dated Treasury bills and continue to monitor for any additional tremors.
If the U.S. Treasury as an issuer were actually to default, it would have very significant, hard to predict, and likely lasting effects on investors, issuers, and markets alike.
In a word, it would make the Cyclone Roller Coaster at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair look like a kiddie ride.
(Strictly speaking Gary, that’s more than a word.)
For readers puzzled at the Cyclone reference, it’s because the SEC chair was riffing off how president Franklin Roosevelt signed the Securities Act of 1933 on the same day as he opened the Chicago World Fair and heralded it as start of “a century of even greater progress”.
For what it’s worth, default fears are probably a little overblown. The White House is likely to prioritise debt payments, and, while there might be an accident, simply slash all other payments and let the Republicans wear the political fallout of soldiers, police, old people etc going unpaid.
The risk is therefore probably more economic than financial. If it triggers a recession (and immediate and massive cuts to government spending would almost certainly do the trick) it could even cause Treasuries to rally.
That said, markets are clearly worried. One-year US credit-default swaps have now rocketed to almost 150 bps, smashing past the peaks seen during past debt ceiling stand-offs.
Anyway, beyond the debt ceiling debacle comments, the speech is a pretty good overview of all the stuff the SEC wants to do with/to (delete according to own opinion on how good these reforms are) the $24tn Treasury market.
Mainly, these are broadening central clearing in USTs, registering all relevant dealers, regulating a rash of new trading platforms, and promoting greater transparency in US government debt trading. It’s a subject Alphaville is . . . interested in. We think you should be as well."

AI-Focused Blockchain CryptoGPT Raises $10M Funding at $250M Valuation
CryptoGPT recently rolled out AI assistant “Alex” and is developing its ZK rollup layer 2 blockchain and a data-to-AI engine, which collects, encrypts and transfers data for commercial applications.
Zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 2 blockchain CryptoGPT has cashed in on the recent surge in interest around artificial intelligence (AI) to raise $10 million in funding.
The Series A round, which was led by market maker DWF Labs — which has emerged as one of the most active investors during the crypto bear market — gave the AI-focused blockchain a $250 million valuation, according to a statement.
“Instead of applying ZK technology to payments, CryptoGPT integrates it for private data transfers,” CryptoGPT said in the statement on Monday. The proceeds of the new funding will be used to grow its developer team globally and build on its regional presence in the Asian markets, said Dejan Erja, co-founder and chief technology officer of the AI-focused blockchain.
CryptoGPT’s broad aim is to allow users to earn money by monetizing their data across fitness, dating, gaming and education. It also plans to roll out non-fungible tokens (NFT) that store the owner’s activity data.
“Turn every task in your daily life into a source of income” the company brags. Naturally, there’s also a vapourcoin designed to cash in on the ChatGPT frenzy, $GPT. Of the supposed 3bn “max supply”, CryptoGPT says 6 per cent is in circulation, which currently has a “market cap” of $13mn.
We can’t even."
Asset management chiefs — changing of the guard,Fund management,"A new generation of asset management chief executives have called time on a “golden decade” for their industry, warning that it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate the competing pressures of markets, regulators and politicians.
“The complexity of the demands on an asset manager are clearly increasing,” said Ali Dibadj, chief executive of Janus Henderson. “Clients are asking more of all of us, regulators are asking more from all of us, and our clients’ clients are asking more from us.”&nbsp;
Katie Koch, chief executive of Los Angeles-based TCW Group, said asset managers were “facing increasing complexity around evolving regulation, migration of investment opportunities from public to private markets, globalisation of the opportunity set and the more recent politically charged portfolio management environment”.
After a decade of zero rates and quantitative easing that pushed equity markets to record highs, investors are grappling with the challenge of a regime change towards both higher inflation and higher interest rates.
“Asset management used to be a rising tide that would lift all boats and that’s no longer true,” said Yie-Hsin Hung, chief executive of State Street Global Advisors.
The Financial Times identified at least 18 chief executives who have taken the reins of big asset managers since the start of 2022. This new guard is charged with stabilising their businesses following the worst year for the roughly $60tn industry since the financial crisis.
Big falls across markets have combined with investor outflows and spiralling costs to compound pressure on active asset managers that have been fighting the march of passive investing.
Investors globally pulled $530bn from investment funds (excluding short-term money market funds) last year, the fund industry’s worst for new business since 2008, according to data provider Morningstar.
Investment managers’ revenues are underpinned by the fees they charge on assets under management, and falling assets are putting cost-to-income ratios — a key measure of investment manager profitability — under pressure, especially for less efficient players.
“The golden decade for asset management is over,” said Stefan Hoops, chief executive of DWS, adding that investors now faced a market environment where “not everything is going up and up and up”, but “costs are”.
Last week BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, warned that the “traditional investing approach” of 60 per cent stocks and 40 per cent fixed income will serve investors poorly over the long term, calling time on a strategy that has been a cornerstone of many asset managers for more than 30 years.
“The complexity of the markets right now — not just equities and bonds, but consumer behaviour, economics, geopolitics and regulation — is creating a lot of volatility and uncertainty,” said Andrew Schlossberg, chief executive of Invesco. “That makes creating a long-term business strategy challenging and we think it’s going to be with us for a while.”
Asset managers have responded to profitability pressures by trying to diversify their businesses, adding higher-margin products such as private assets or targeting new client types or geographic regions, sometimes through acquisitions. Their business models have become increasingly elaborate and difficult to manage as a result.
“The challenges of complexity are greater than the challenges of scale,” said Rob Sharps, chief executive of T Rowe Price. Customers now come to T Rowe through multiple channels, including direct access on brokerage platforms, through advisers or to buy specific products such as alternatives. “Then we do that around the globe.”&nbsp;
He added: “It becomes a complicated business especially with the proliferation of regulation and different client preferences for vehicles, strategies or structures in end markets.”
Increasingly fragmented and complex regulation is another area of concern, particularly around the fast-growing sector of investing on the basis of environment, social and governance (ESG) factors. Asset managers are trying to balance the demands of a highly interconnected investment industry against retreats from globalisation and the increasingly politicised nature of ESG in the US.&nbsp;
“Regulation is becoming much more complicated,” said Matthew Beesley, chief executive of Jupiter. “Regulatory pressures have increased in every region. We are also seeing regulatory divergences emerging within Europe following the UK’s exit from the EU.”
For example, European regulators took a lead on defining standards for ESG investing, with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which aims to improve transparency and prevent greenwashing. But the UK is consulting on its own version of rules, which could take a different approach to the EU in the aftermath of the country leaving the EU, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing rules around ESG disclosures.
Karin van Baardwijk, chief executive of Dutch asset manager Robeco, said that with the growing demand and associated supply of ESG products, “the risk of greenwashing is becoming more prevalent. This can damage the credibility of our industry as a whole . . . and will ultimately lead to more regulation.”&nbsp;
In the US, asset managers including BlackRock and Vanguard are finding themselves a lightning rod for both sides of the political spectrum. Republican politicians are attacking them over the use of ESG metrics, contending that they are hostile to fossil fuel investments, while Democrats have criticised them for failing to do more to fight climate change.
Meanwhile, asset managers are locked in a war for talent, notably in areas such as private assets, technology and sustainable investing, and trying to keep investing in their businesses to stay ahead of the competition.
“The pressure on cost, inflation of wages, and the war on talent is really here to stay,” said Naïm Abou-Jaoudé, chief executive of NY Life Investment Management.
“And the pressures we have on regulation, compliance and all the requirements mean the business is becoming more demanding . . . all of this is costing a lot in terms of investment to be really efficient as an organisation.”
The chief executives all agreed that investors today face a future quite different from those of their predecessors in recent decades.
To navigate this more complex environment asset managers will “need to work harder and be even more innovative . . . operating across traditional silos,” according to Marc Nachmann, global head of asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs.
“More extensive relationships and resources — globally distributed and amplified by better technology — will be increasingly needed for idea generation, deal sourcing, portfolio construction, and value creation,” he said. “These are not small investments to make.”"
Insight Investment ditched market prices in gilts crisis,Fund management,"One of the UK pension industry’s biggest asset managers abandoned mark-to-market pricing on funds reeling from the country’s government bond crisis last year, instead choosing higher values that presented a rosier picture of its position.
The highly unusual and previously unreported move by Insight Investment came at the height of the September crisis that began with then-prime minister Liz Truss’s disastrous “mini” Budget.
The typically sleepy liability-driven investment industry, which serves defined benefit pension schemes, was rocked by the sharp fall in UK government bond prices after Truss’s government announced unfunded tax cuts.
A crisis quickly engulfed the £1.4tn sector, which is dominated by the BNY Mellon-owned Insight, BlackRock and Legal &amp; General Investment Management.
A vicious cycle developed in which drops in gilt prices forced LDI managers to sell more gilts to raise cash, because their funds used leverage. Most LDI managers also marked down the value of their funds each day in line with plunging gilt prices.
But on the day the Bank of England stepped in with a rescue scheme, Insight disregarded market prices and set its own, pushing its funds’ net asset values per share higher, in some cases markedly.
Insight told the Financial Times this month that its LDI funds “operated as normal through the dislocation”. Chief executive Abdallah Nauphal told the House of Commons work and pensions committee last year that Insight was “never forced sellers of gilts . . . largely because we have . . . a more conservative buffer”. He added that the environment at that time had been “tough”.
But Insight’s actions on September 28 illustrate how “tough” it was. By that morning, LDI funds were starting to crack. The BoE later described this as a period when market participants were “shouting on the phone” for help. Insight had just hours left before it reported the value on its funds for September 27 — a typically humdrum daily process that involves scraping data on the previous day’s gilts prices and reporting the numbers each afternoon.
Marking the funds to market at September 27 rates, close to the lowest point in the crisis, would have generated a grim result. Instead, for that one day, Insight took another path. After the BoE announced its targeted bond-buying rescue scheme at 11am on September 28, which instantly pushed gilts prices higher, it gathered its five-person fund board, which comprised three independent members and others from BNY and Insight. They decided to mark the books for September 27 higher by disregarding that day’s gilt moves and marking to market around prices that had prevailed in the middle of September 26.
“Markets were dysfunctional, as stated by the&nbsp;Bank of England,” Insight told the&nbsp;FT. Its fund board therefore had discretion under its prospectus to apply what is known as a fair value adjustment to market prices. “A decision of this nature is made in the best interest of all shareholders in a fund,” it added.
Industry experts say the price adjustment prevented Insight from making demands for cash of its clients. “NAVs should tell you asset values,” said one. “The injured party is trust in the system.”
BNY Mellon’s chief executive Robin Vince told the FT last month he was proud of how Insight had handled the crisis and pleased with how it has drawn in new clients as a result.
No other LDI manager tweaked its prices, industry experts say, and other gilt market participants say they were still able to find reference gilts prices throughout the crisis.
“We didn’t like the prices, but [using them to mark to market] was the right thing to do,” said one person at another LDI manager. He added that Insight has come out of the crisis “smelling of roses” in part because of its decision not to use that day’s gilt prices.
Simeon Willis, chief investment officer at pensions consultancy XPS Investment, said altering prices was “not common practice” and he did not see it as a “model” for dealing with periods of extreme stress in future.
Publicly available data shows the impact of Insight’s adjustments. In one case — the LDI Solutions Plus Partially Funded Index-Linked Gilts Funds 2061-2070 — the net asset value per share leapt from 45.57p for September 26 to 79.54p the next day.
That was at odds with the falls in gilt prices on September 27, which pushed the yield on the UK’s 40-year inflation-linked government bond up some 0.68 percentage points, according to Reuters data. The BoE has described the “speed and scale” of gilt moves around that time as “unprecedented”.
The Central Bank of Ireland, which regulates funds managed by Insight, declined to comment on dealings with individual firms. It has previously advised LDI managers to enhance their resilience.
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has said it “expects asset managers to take any necessary or appropriate action to ensure they do not create risks to market integrity or financial stability”.
This story has been updated to reflect that Insight’s price adjustments prevented it from having to call for additional cash from clients rather than shielding it from collateral calls from banks."
James Anderson returns to investing with Agnelli family backing,Fund management,"James Anderson, the maverick fund manager, is returning to full-time investing a year after retiring from Baillie Gifford and is teaming up with the Agnelli family holding company for an entrepreneurial venture.
Lingotto Investment Management, a new $3bn firm owned by Exor, has appointed Anderson to its team of investors. He will launch a fund focused on innovation in both public and private markets, starting with about $500mn in assets.
John Elkann, chair of Stellantis and scion of the billionaire Agnelli industrial dynasty, told the Financial Times that his vision for Lingotto was to “provide a home for very talented investment management professionals to join a place which is entrepreneurial and much focused on letting them do what they’re good at and what they love”.
He added: “We’re not saying we want to play in the alternatives space and we want to build a $100bn business in three years. That’s not the way we reflect. We feel there are very capable investors out there . . . and they don’t necessarily want to be part of a big platform and they don’t necessarily want to be alone.”
Lingotto will be chaired by George Osborne, the former UK chancellor who is now a banker at boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw. Osborne has been working with Elkann over the past five years as the chair of Exor’s partners’ council, a role he is stepping back from.
Anderson, 63, is chair of Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. But he is best known for the almost four decades he spent at Baillie Gifford, where he helped turn the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unlikely star of tech investing through early bets on the likes of Tesla and Amazon.
During Anderson’s tenure as manager of Baillie Gifford’s flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, from April 30 2000 to March 31 2022, the company gained 1,155 per cent against a 354 per cent return for its benchmark FTSE All-World index during the same period.
However, Scottish Mortgage’s performance has soured since Anderson’s exit, which coincided with a regime change in monetary policy. Scottish Mortgage’s shares lost a third of their value in the 12 months to March 31 as growth stocks were curbed by higher interest rates.
Anderson, who at Baillie Gifford was a longtime shareholder in Exor companies, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ferrari, acknowledged that “it’s been a difficult 18 months” for growth investing but said that the long-term opportunity in sectors including artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewable energy was greater than ever.
“One of the great puzzles to me is that markets have become so sceptical and short term at a time when the pace of innovation and change, and the prospects of returns over five, 10 and 20 years, has got greater than less,” he said.
He added: “It’s essential that we carry on investing in these sectors rather than worrying about what the Federal Reserve is going to do next.”
The initial $3bn funding for the new venture will be split evenly between Exor and Covea, the French insurer. The joint investment into Lingotto comes out of the relationship built between the two companies after Covea agreed to buy Bermuda-based reinsurer PartnerRe from Exor in 2021 for $9bn.
In addition to Anderson, Lingotto begins with two other managing partners who are already working at Exor. Matteo Scolari, who joined Exor in 2015 from hedge fund Eton Park, will run a hedge fund strategy focused on public equities investing.
Nikhil Srinivasan, who joined Exor in 2018 after serving as the chief investment officer at Generali and Allianz, will focus on shorter-duration investments in private companies and special situations. His fund was among the backers of a recent $130mn fundraising in UK biotech group Ascend, taking a near 7 per cent stake.
Anderson will continue to be based in Edinburgh but will also have an office in London where Lingotto is based. The company is led by Exor’s longtime chief financial officer Enrico Vellano. In time, it plans to raise money from external investors and add other portfolio managers to the venture.
“It’s an entrepreneurial project,” Vellano said. “We don’t want to judge success in terms of the size of assets under management but in terms of the quality. We want to find people who share our view about how to manage capital.”
Lingotto is named after the historic Fiat factory in Turin, which was inaugurated in 1923 and whose rooftop racetrack featured in the 1969 film The Italian Job.
Anderson last year donated $100mn to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University in Bologna, one of the largest known donations to a university in continental Europe."
G7 claims success with price cap that keeps Russian oil flowing,G7,"When G7 leaders prepared to implement a price cap on Russian oil last summer, some industry veterans cast doubt on whether the complex system would work. A year later, western officials believe they have largely been proven right: the Kremlin’s revenues are down but its oil is still flowing.
The price cap on Russian crude and refined petroleum products was engineered by the US in response to a planned EU ban on European companies providing shipping, or other maritime services, to Russian oil cargoes.
By permitting those companies to continue to service Russian cargoes if the oil is sold at a discount, Washington hoped to curtail the Kremlin’s revenue while ensuring Russian exports continued — to protect a global economy struggling with high energy costs.
US officials felt they had “silenced the sceptics” by keeping Russian oil flowing, says Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and now head of commodities research at RBC Capital Markets.
“If we had never had the services ban, we never would have had price caps,” Croft explains. “The goal was to keep the molecules on the market.”
Russian oil exports in April reached 8.3mn barrels a day, the highest since April 2020, driven in large part by China and India, which imported, respectively, 2.1mn b/d and 2mn b/d of Russian crude, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
At the same time, Russian monthly oil export revenues are down 27 per cent year on year at $15bn, according to the IEA’s estimates. In response, last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin changed how the Kremlin taxes its oil companies, switching to a levy based on the price of Brent crude minus a fixed discount, rather than the much lower price of Urals — the country’s main crude export blend.
A member of the G7-led coalition described the Russian tax move to the FT as “prima facie evidence” that the country’s revenue was suffering due to the cap.
However, the full story of the cap’s impact is more complicated. The western restrictions were supposed to reduce Russian revenues by limiting the price buyers could pay for Russian crude and diesel to $60 and $100 a barrel, respectively. Indeed, in January, the first full month of restrictions on Russian crude, the average quoted price of Urals fell to $49/b, significantly below both the cap and the average price of international benchmark Brent, which was $82/b.

However, traders say that the discount for Russian crude that widened in December and January was a reflection of new non-western buyers using the G7 restrictions to push prices down, rather than of western buyers complying with the cap. Now that Russia has formalised more ways to get its oil to new customers without using European shipping, or insurance that must comply with the caps, prices for Russian crude have started to recover.
The IEA calculated last month that the weighted average price for Russian crude exports had risen above the $60/b price cap in April, with one crude sold in Russia’s far east, known as ESPO-blend, selling for as much as $74/b.
In this way, some critics say the sanctions and associated price cap simply pushed the bulk of Russian oil trading into the shadows: moving it from well-known global trading and shipping companies to new, lesser-known, less-experienced operators. In response, the US Treasury last month issued an alert, warning about the possible evasion of the price cap on Russian oil, particularly involving exports of ESPO-blend.
“Some symbolic targeted prosecutions” to serve as a “warning” to any US or European companies involved in such trade are a possibility, says Croft.
Still, any major change to the price cap mechanism is unlikely, she adds. “I don’t hear, at least in Washington, a lot of hand wringing about the cash that Putin is making in oil,” she says. “I think they point to volumes and say we staved off an energy crisis with this policy.”
The price of Brent has fallen about 10 per cent since the crude price cap was introduced on December 5. Jorge León, senior vice-president at energy analysts Rystad, says the G7 is unlikely to lower the price cap to match that drop. “They could lower the price cap more but, the more you reduce it, the more likely it is that you could see an unintended reaction from Russia — shutting production, for example, that would send the price much higher,” he says. “It is a fine calculation [for the G7].”
An alternative could be to target refiners in countries such as India, which are processing large volumes of discounted Russian crude into fuels, some of which are then shipped back to Europe. But, while some EU officials have expressed concern over Europe’s continued purchases of such products, any action to block imports would risk disrupting Russian exports and driving up prices, says Amrita Sen, director of research at consultants Energy Aspects. “So far, the sanctions have been designed to keep the oil flowing and they haven’t really been designed to ‘hurt’ Russia,” she says."
Marco Garzetti plans stake in fund manager GAM to retain its independence,GAM Holding AG,"Entrepreneur Marco Garzetti said he would invest SFr65mn in GAM as an alternative to Liontrust’s planned acquisition and would do “whatever it takes” to keep the Swiss fund management group independent.
Garzetti said on Friday that he disagreed with GAM’s board that the £96mn all-share offer from London-listed investment boutique Liontrust was in the best interest of all stakeholders.
“To the contrary, I am convinced GAM will continue to have many advantages as an independent Swiss asset management company in the future,” the Swiss entrepreneur said in an open letter to GAM shareholders.
The offer from Garzetti, who set up Taure Invest for the purpose of investing in GAM, marks the latest twist in the Swiss asset manager’s attempts to secure its future and could undermine its sale to Liontrust.
GAM has twice postponed its annual results to find a buyer following a turbulent five years for the business, blighted by a falling share price and customer outflows.
Garzetti said he had submitted a plan along with colleagues at Taure to the board of GAM, stating he was prepared to make “a long-term commitment” to “fundamentally turn the company around and make a fresh start”.
Garzetti, who holds an 84 per cent stake in Taure, added: “Together with Swiss partners, I am willing to put GAM back on the road to success, both with financial resources and with personal commitment. We will do whatever it takes.”
Garzetti, who has been involved in the asset management industry for over three decades, said he would invest SFr34mn in newly issued GAM shares to become the majority shareholder and provide a loan of SFr31mn to “secure the urgently needed liquidity”.
He said GAM could reach a pre-tax profit of SFr50mn in 2026 and noted that Taure had already made “extensive preparations” for the sale of GAM’s fund services business. Taure would also overhaul GAM’s board and management team.
Liontrust, which made its offer earlier this month, is also planning on selling GAM’s fund services arm but will retain the investment management business, to create a £53bn asset manager. Liontrust will provide two loans of up to £17.8mn to help restructure GAM.
However, the deal has faced a backlash from other quarters. A group of investors led by French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has taken a stake in GAM, which it plans on raising to at least 10 per cent.
The Niel-led group said days after the Liontrust deal was struck that the takeover “needlessly favours the bidder and is contrary to the principles of Swiss takeover law”.
GAM has been through a calamitous period since a scandal in 2018 over its holdings of illiquid debt.
Its former star fund manager Tim Haywood had bought bonds from companies related to Lex Greensill’s now collapsed supply chain finance business Greensill Capital, which counted former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser. Haywood’s funds were ultimately liquidated.
GAM and Liontrust declined to comment."
Ukraine war turns Russia into a nation of gold bugs,Gold,"After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the country’s invasion of Ukraine last February, Natalia Smirnova’s phone started ringing off the hook. The financial adviser’s Russian clients were panicking. “Should I buy gold?” one asked her. “If worst comes to worst, at least I can bury it.”
That attitude was shared by many — and turned Russia into an unexpected nation of gold bugs almost overnight.
Demand for gold bars and coins last year grew faster in Russia than in any other country, rising to nearly five times the level of the previous year, according to data from the World Gold Council.
While Russia has long been one of the world’s largest gold producers, accounting for almost a tenth of global production, its retail investors have historically shunned the metal, partly due to a 20 per cent value added tax on purchases of bars.
People usually turned to dollars and euros during times of trouble. But that has all changed.
“Private citizens are looking for a way to save money, and euros and dollars are in short supply, so the popularity of gold has surged,” said Vitaly Nesis, chief executive of Polymetal, an Anglo-Russian gold producer. “As long as we experience geopolitical instability, the demand for gold may be significant.”
The switch to gold has been strongly encouraged by the Russian government.
The central bank in March restricted sales of foreign currency, and on the same day Putin scrapped VAT on gold bar purchases, sparking a surge in buying.
Finance minister Anton Siluanov told Russians that the dollar was “volatile” and exposed to “various risks”, highlighting that precious metals were an attractive alternative. “Investing in gold will be a great alternative to dollars amid an unstable geopolitical situation,” he said in a press release in March.
Russian buyers were soon queueing for gold. As banks rushed to meet demand for the smaller bars preferred by retail investors, Sberbank, a giant state-owned bank, warned its customers about a potential shortage of the smaller sizes. Sberbank accounts for about 80 per cent of gold bars and coins purchased in Russia, according to its press office.
In Russia, many authorised dealers can distribute coins but only banks are allowed to sell bars. Despite this, personal advertisements of second-hand bars flooded Avito, the country’s leading online marketplace for used goods.
To calm the frenzy, the Russian central bank stopped buying gold on March 15 — two weeks after its first gold purchase in two years — but resumed 10 days later. “The market was disoriented,” the bank’s first deputy governor, Alexei Zabotkin, said later by way of explanation for the bank’s activity.
In 2022, global gold demand rose 18 per cent to its highest level in more than a decade, propelled by large purchases from central banks, as countries sought to diversify away from the dollar.
Industry analysts believe the Russian central bank was a significant buyer, but they are not certain because the institution stopped reporting its reserves soon after the war in Ukraine began.
Gold prices rose almost 20 per cent from their trough in November to the end of January, fuelled in part by purchases from Asia and Russia, according to Bernard Dahdah, commodities analyst at Natixis.
“There is a lot of effort by Russia and China to make the dollar [less influential] — to stop it from being the petrodollar,” he said.
The price has fallen 4.4 per cent this month as euphoria about China’s post-coronavirus reopening has waned.
The recent policy changes in Russia are similar to the way China opened up its gold market at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, he said. “The Chinese made it much easier for investors to buy into gold. And that is when we saw the boom.”
Despite last year’s surge, Russian demand for gold bars and coins last year was only 2 per cent of the global total, according to World Gold Council data. China, at 19 per cent, remains the world’s biggest buyer, followed by Germany and India.
Russian gold miners are also desperate to find new buyers as people seek to diversify their savings. Before the war, Russia consumed just a fifth of its gold, exporting the rest.
Towards the end of 2022, Russia succeeded in redirecting gold exports to Asia, specifically China, said Valery Yemelyanov, stock market analyst at BCS World of Investments. Russian gold exports to China skyrocketed by 63 per cent, growing $150mn year on year, Chinese customs data shows.
Under-developed infrastructure for retail gold investment may, however, dampen public enthusiasm. People can only sell the bars back to banks, for example.
Storing gold is another issue because many people store gold at home. Every scratch can reduce the value of a gold bar, said Smirnova, the financial consultant. “Not everyone understands they cannot keep bars in a shoebox.”"
Why investors are going gaga for gold,Gold,"How can an investor protect themselves against a US government default? Once, that was a crazy question to ask. But today the bizarre has become almost normal in American politics.
And while US president Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have both indicated they want to cut a deal to raise America’s $31tn debt ceiling — and thus avoid a putative default — significant sticking points remain.
So Wall Street analysts are now furtively weighing the protection options as they grapple with this new tail risk.
Some, like those at JPMorgan, argue that “diversification is the best defence,” and urge investors to “consider currencies and precious metals like the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and gold [and] high quality international equities.” That sounds sensible.
However, others are more focused: RBC Capital markets last week suggested that “gold looks like one of the few likely candidates that would bear the burden of resulting market flows” from default anxiety.
And a survey from Bloomberg this week echoes this. Gold is the top safety choice for professional and retail investors, by a long margin, with 52 and 46 per cent, respectively, citing this.
That is followed by Treasuries, selected by 14 and 15 per cent of professional and retail investors (which sounds counter-intuitive until you realise that a default would spark a US recession). Bitcoin lags well behind in third place, followed by the dollar, yen and Swiss franc.
One hopes that this is all simply theoretical. But even if a default is averted, it is worth noting the answers. For one thing, it shows the degree to which eurozone leaders have failed to convince investors that their currency is a viable alternative to the dollar.
Second, this pattern is a nasty snub to crypto evangelists. After all, bitcoin was created as an alternative to the established dollar-denominated financial order. If most mainstream investors shun it when that established system is threatened with crisis, that does not bode well for bitcoin’s future.
But the third, and most interesting, point revolves around gold. A couple of decades ago, investing in this asset seemed bizarrely retro, given that it does not pay a return.
But this month the gold price has been trading close to an all-time high (unadjusted for inflation) of $2,069.40 a troy ounce, after rallying 20 per cent since November, and doubling since 2016.
More importantly, some subtle but striking shifts have recently occurred in its trading pattern. Traditionally, the gold price has been inversely correlated to inflation-linked long term Treasury yields. The reason is that they both can act as an anti-inflation safety hedge — but since bonds offer returns, they typically become more attractive when real yields rise.
However, since early 2022, that relationship has broken down: real yields have climbed, but the gold price has risen too. Why? Analysts at Bridgewater, the US hedge fund, say one big reason is that many central banks have recently been gobbling up gold because they want to diversify their reserves away from the dollar, following western sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
Indeed, data from the World Gold Council published this month shows that central bank purchases hit a record high in the first quarter of this year, after record annual highs in 2022.
And the Council’s Louise Street predicts that “central bank buying is likely to remain strong and will be a cornerstone of demand throughout 2023”. It is a striking reminder of how frustrated countries like China and Russia feel with the dollar-based order, even if they lack a viable alternative to this right now.
However, Bridgewater thinks that another factor driving the rally is that the past 15 years of quantitative easing and recent high inflation have left central banks and retail investors alike reaching for gold as a store of value.
“There has been a shift from investors primarily evaluating&nbsp;gold&nbsp;as an alternative to other dollar-denominated savings to increasingly evaluating&nbsp;gold&nbsp;as an alternative to the dollar,” Bridgwater notes, pointing out that the traditional correlation between the dollar and gold price has also recently broken down.
It is thus little wonder that investors — be they central banks or befuddled consumers — embrace gold as part of a hedging strategy against a US default.
Maybe this pattern will change with a debt deal. Indeed, the gold price has recently dipped slightly on McCarthy’s comments. And when America last faced a similar debt ceiling crisis in 2011, the gold price also rose — but then sunk after a deal was made.
However, I suspect that history will not repeat itself so neatly this time, given the concerns about inflation, the weaponisation of the greenback and the fact that America’s political dysfunction will not end with any debt ceiling deal.
The key point is that gold is now a good barometer not just of global instability, but of US dysfunction too. In that sense, there is poetic, albeit ghastly, symbolism in the way that Donald Trump, former president and a leading 2024 Republican presidential contender, has embraced the idea of default — from the safety of his own homes, which are (in)famously full of gold furnishings.

Industry awaits update to FTC’s ‘green guides’,Greenwashing,"Corporate sustainability claims are expected to come under fresh scrutiny after a US regulator concluded a public consultation into its 11-year old anti-greenwashing guidelines.
Public feedback on the US Federal Trade Commission’s current version of the “green guides” — used to police environmental marketing claims — has shown how several groups are at odds over how both to define as well as to enforce greenwashing infractions.
During the consultation period, several consumer advocacy groups proposed tougher enforcement for financial products.
Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning coalition of consumer, labour and community groups, has recommended that the FTC include terms such as “Paris-aligned” as it relates financial institutions’ use of “net zero” and other commitments to fossil fuel transition plans.
“The explosive rise of the ESG investment space has raised new questions about what constitutes fair and faithful marketing and disclosure around financial products and services,” AFR said in an April 24 letter to the FTC.
However, other companies are fearful of increased regulation and enforcement which could put them at risk of incurring “potential substantial civil penalties,” says Jon Direnfeld, a partner at law firm Orrick.
Switzerland-based food group Nestlé says it supports the FTC’s green guides, but does not want these policies added to the agency’s enforcement rules for environmental claims.
It is “critical” for the FTC to keep its green guides “flexible and nimble,” Nestlé said in an April 24 letter to the agency, adding these policies should be updated more frequently as technology and business practices evolve.
Already, the FTC has shown increased aggressiveness in hunting for greenwashing. Last year, it settled with US retailers Walmart and Kohl’s for marketing dozens of rayon textile products as bamboo. The companies paid $3mn and $2.5mn in penalties, respectively.
“Walk down the aisle at any major store [and] you are likely to see packages trumpeting their low carbon footprint, their energy efficiency, or their ‘sustainability’,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in December. The agency’s green guides are supposed to “help companies avoid running afoul of the law’s ban on deceptive advertising”.
The FTC’s decision to consult on its “green guides” comes amid a growing push by global regulators to combat greenwashing. Last March, the European Commission proposed rules to fight greenwashing in the rapidly growing bond market. And, last year, the FTC’s counterpart in the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority, banned HSBC’s advertisements after being found to be misleading about the bank’s own green credentials. It was the first time the regulator had barred ads by a bank on greenwashing grounds.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is also writing separate rules to root out greenwashing in the financial sector. Last year, the agency proposed to toughen the regulation of financial product names, especially those of investment funds with sustainable themes. While financial companies said they support the SEC’s effort, they have also asked for changes.
“If it’s easy to tell if milk is fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier to tell if ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’ funds are really what they say they are,” SEC chair Gary Gensler said last year.
As part of its greenwashing enforcement, the SEC last year settled charges with BNY Mellon and Goldman Sachs over allegedly misleading environmental, social and governance claims by the banks. The banks agreed to pay $1.5mn and $4mn in penalties, respectively.
“Consumers and markets continue to place a premium on corporate sustainability and climate change policies,” says Stacy Kray, co-head of Orrick’s environmental practice.
For companies, “we do see risks, including anti-ESG enforcement and legislation efforts led by Republican politicians in the US,” she adds.
In March, 21 Republican state attorneys-general challenged ESG-minded asset managers over the effects of their commitments to net zero carbon emission targets.
In a letter addressed to some of the largest US fund managers, originally reported by Reuters, the attorneys-general said “many of you have committed to take actions inconsistent with your clients’ financial interests”. Several asset managers are also members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, set up to accelerate the transition towards net zero global emissions.
Amid this tension between regulators and politics, companies will need to spend more time and money scrutinising their own green claims before making them public, Kray believes.
“We don’t think this means that companies will no longer try to be green,” she says. “Rather that companies will need to be more rigorous with the governance controls and procedures they use to manage and verify sustainability claims.”"
HSBC abandons plans for UK pensions business,HSBC Holdings PLC,"HSBC has abandoned plans to capture a slice of the UK’s&nbsp;£62bn annual workplace pension market after the banking giant failed to convince employers to sign up to a new scheme it spent four years developing.
The London-based lender had ambitions to branch out from its core UK banking services and offer its own-branded pension scheme, which would have managed the retirement pots of other companies and their staff.
Operators of these multiemployer pension plans, known as “master trusts” make money from the investment and management fees generated from employee contributions.
In 2019, HSBC became the first lender to obtain regulatory approval to launch a master trust. Since then it has made a number of senior hires and started promoting the scheme to employers.
In the master trust’s 2021 annual accounts, filed in March last year, HSBC said it planned for the scheme to be operational in the “coming year”. As recently as September, the bank was still recruiting for the business.
But HSBC has since quietly dropped the plans after failing to drum up enough business. Two industry professionals told the Financial Times that companies had been concerned about the level of fees and the idea of a bank getting involved in pensions.
“HSBC were too late getting to the market, as it was already consolidating,” said Damon Hopkins, head of defined contribution workplace savings, at Broadstone, the employee benefit consultants.
“Unfortunately the banks, in particular, have a bad reputation for dabbling in pensions. While HSBC is a big name, I think that the consulting world, who drive a lot of where the business goes in master trusts, might have preferred a well established name in the pensions market.”
HSBC confirmed “the unwinding of the HSBC Master Trust and its entities in the UK, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements” in a statement to the FT.
“Following an extensive review, this strategic direction has been taken to reallocate resources towards other priorities,” the bank added.
While only a tiny business in terms of its vast global balance sheet, the retreat is indicative of the pressure being exerted by HSBC’s largest shareholder Ping An, which has been campaigning to split the bank along east-west lines and criticised its persistently high-cost base.
In response, executives have been doubling-down on investment in Asia and closing or selling non-strategic businesses, such as its retail operations in France and Canada.
HSBC declined to say how much it had spent developing its pension master trust, which had required authorisation from the Pensions Regulator as well as the hiring of professional services, such as auditing and legal advice, and the appointment of trustees for the scheme’s governance.
The scheme received a £1.7mn capital injection from the bank, which has also borne its operational costs, according to accounts filed with Companies House.
HSBC had been aiming to take a slice of the booming workplace pension market, which was chalking up about £62bn in contributions each year, thanks to a government policy that sees workers automatically enrolled into a company pension.
Since the automatic enrolment policy was introduced in 2012, more than 10mn savers have been brought into workplace pensions, many now in mega funds, also known as master trusts.
HSBC was attempting to break into a sector that is traditionally dominated by insurers and pension savings companies. More than 30 companies have received authorisation to run a master trust and HSBC is the only bank on the list."

Greetings from that magical corner of America known as Big Sur, on the rocky Californian coast line. I have escaped here for a couple of days to recharge after the frenzy of the annual Milken conference in the famous wellness centres. These pride themselves on their fantastic yoga and healing sessions — and laudable commitments to being green.
But just how planet-friendly are yoga pants and mats in reality? Not as much as you might think. See below for an illuminating piece by Kaori on the dirty secret of the “stretch” in yoga clothes that sustainability enthusiasts might not know about. And check out the latest piece in our series about the extraordinary innovations emerging around hydrogen — this time in relation to Toyota’s work to develop hydrogen-fuelled cars and trucks. This innovation road is strewn with big challenges, but also some striking opportunities. Read on — and let us know what you think. (Gillian Tett)
Last week the Japanese auto group Toyota announced it had struck a deal with the North American trucking group PACCAR to develop two new long-distance haulage vehicles called Kenworth and Peterbilt. Nothing odd about that, you might think: mobility companies often team up in different parts of the supply chain, and haulage is a vast business.
But these vehicles come with a striking twist: the trucks, which will roll off the assembly line later this year and go into mass production in 2025, are powered by hydrogen fuel cell modules instead of diesel engines. And the two companies hope to “realise a future where hydrogen fuel cell technology can power heavy-duty trucks that can travel across highways throughout the US with zero emissions”, as Christopher Yang, a top Toyota executive, explained.
Or as John Rich, PACCAR vice-president, declared: “This is not a pilot. This is not an experiment. It’s not a trial. We’ve done all that. This is a tool that is ready to go to work — purchased, deployed and supported with all the durability and uptime expectations of the diesel engine . . . Hydrogen presents the best zero-emission technology solution for long-distance Class 8 trucks.”
Some cynics might question that. Never mind that hydrogen has traditionally been viewed as a rather dangerous fuel in the eyes of the American public, due to the infamous 1937 Hindenburg disaster (when a hydrogen air balloon exploded). The more practical challenge today is whether there will ever be the infrastructure to support the widespread usage of hydrogen vehicles. It took decades to roll out America’s networks of “gas” (ie petrol) stations along its highways. And while electric vehicle usage has recently soared in the passenger car market, and a network of EV recharging stations has emerged on the east and west coasts of America, there are currently very few hydrogen fuelling stations — precisely because this fuel is relatively new.
However, Toyota has been quietly developing hydrogen vehicles since 2021 in the US, and already launched a passenger vehicle series called the Mirai. Last week I did a test drive in one of these along the freeways and roads in Los Angeles, and can report that it is a remarkably nippy and smooth vehicle that drives in a manner similar to an EV. To support these, Toyota is working with oil majors such as Shell, Exxon and Chevron to roll out charging stations in California. This is proceeding relatively slowly, due to the horrific complexities of American local planning laws. But since the Mirai has a range of up to 400 miles, and dozens of stations have now been installed, these passenger vehicles are now on the road in California.
However, the holy grail for Toyota is the trucking sector. “We think that hydrogen holds out more promise than electric batteries for big vehicles,” Gill Pratt, a top Toyota executive, told me. One reason is that with current technologies, electric batteries need to be monstrously big and heavy to power trucks. Worse still, charging an electric battery for a truck can take many hours — and truckers do not want to waste this valuable time when they are on the road. EV batteries also require rare earth minerals and metals, such as lithium — and as Elon Musk, the self-styled king of EVs, has often pointed out, these items are in increasingly short supply.
Hydrogen fuel cell modules, by contrast, can be charged in a matter of minutes using pressurised systems (when I was in the port of Los Angeles I saw a Shell-operated pump for trucks that uses a 1000 psi, or pounds force per square inch, system; this is a strikingly high level of pressure.) The modules are far smaller and lighter than electric batteries, and fairly easy to install — which truckers like. The trucks move in a fairly flexible manner (when I took a test trip in one, it kept overtaking traditional trucks on the road). They also use smaller amounts of rare earth minerals. And those Hindenburg-linked safety concerns? The Toyota team insists that modern technology means there are no risks of any 1930s-style explosions (and it has repeatedly fired guns at the vehicles to test this, it says).
Of course, EV evangelists might retort that these comparisons could soon look as outdated as those Hindenburg fears, since engineers are now racing to create smaller and more efficient electric batteries. And one drawback of both hydrogen-fuelled and electric battery vehicles is that they can only be considered truly “green” if the process to create the underlying electricity or hydrogen is carbon-neutral too. Either way, we will certainly hear a great deal more about hydrogen in the coming months, since the Inflation Reduction Act has created some astonishingly large subsidies for hydrogen production in America, relative to Europe and Asia. So much so that Toyota now expects to use hydrogen fuel cells for a host of other purposes, such as regular household energy usage.
Indeed, the one thing that can be stated with confidence is that we are still in a fairly early stage of this race to create clean energy. “We don’t know with certainty what tech solution will be best since there is still so much innovation occurring,” Pratt adds. “So we are exploring several alternatives with a diverse portfolio of solutions.”&nbsp;In plain English: companies need to stay flexible.

Since the coronavirus pandemic pushed millions into exercising at home, interest in yoga has surged to new levels.
In 2020, the yoga wear market grew to a whopping $6.4bn just in North America, according to Fortune Business Insights. The worldwide market for yoga wear was $19.2bn in the same period and is projected to double to $40bn by 2028.&nbsp;
But yoga pants present a major challenge for apparel companies seeking to become greener. Martin Mulvihill, co-founder and general partner at SaferMade, a venture capital firm investing in companies and technologies that eliminate hazardous chemicals from consumer products, told me that “not even the industry leaders are there on yoga pants”.&nbsp;
Recent green efforts by the likes of yoga wear manufacturer Lululemon have not adequately addressed the question of these popular clothes. In 2021, Lululemon partnered with Genomatica, a company developing plant-based nylon via an equity investment. It recently launched its first shirts partially using this plant-based fabric.&nbsp;
While company analysts also applaud Lululemon’s efforts, this new fabric lacks a key feature — stretchiness.
It turns out that is where the biggest problem lies. Achieving that stretchy feel is the biggest challenge for those seeking to replace the petrochemical-based polyurethane that is commonly used in yoga pants.
Not only do synthetic fibres like polyurethane take far more fossil fuel energy to produce than natural fibres, but with each wash, tiny synthetic microplastics are released, polluting waterways and getting eaten up by fish or other marine animals.
Investors are eager to solve the challenge. Mulvihill tells me that Safermade is in talks with three companies that are in early stages of creating bio-based and biodegradable polyurethane. But so far, “none of them have been able to make it with the same stretch and performance”, he said. (Kaori Yoshida, Nikkei)
Green subsidies in the US have tended to be fairly modest. However, as a striking piece in the New York Times notes, last year’s Inflation Reduction Act is now having a far bigger impact than expected, sparking a manufacturing boom — and (yet more) inflationary pressures.

Founders to keep more voting rights under plans to kickstart London IPOs,IPOs,"The UK will permit founders to retain more voting rights in companies seeking to list on the top tier of London’s stock market, under new proposals to lure leading tech groups.
The Financial Conduct Authority on Monday laid out plans to reform rules for company listings and allow more dual class shareholdings, which give certain shareholders greater voting rights than others. The watchdog is aiming to reverse a long-term decline in listings and help London compete with thriving overseas centres such as New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
The moves build on the recommendations of reports this year into the UK fintech sector, by former Worldpay chief executive Ron Kalifa, and the listings regime by Lord Jonathan Hill, former EU financial services commissioner, which both advocated reforms to support and encourage technology companies in Britain — an area prioritised by chancellor Rishi Sunak as part of the City’s future post-Brexit.
The FCA proposed that founders who remain executives and other directors be allowed 20 votes per share on votes&nbsp;to prevent their own removal as directors and to act as a deterrent to unwanted takeovers of the company. This would allow them to control 50 per cent of the voting power while holding just 5 per cent of the total shares, for up to five years. They would relinquish the right if they were no longer directors.
Dual class structures that give certain shareholders greater voting rights than others are common on other markets, particularly in New York, but have been controversial among some UK fund managers who worry about governance standards and argue that share ownership should be based on the principle of “one share, one vote”.
In March, investor concern about Deliveroo’s dual share structure was among factors that hit the food delivery company’s&nbsp;IPO. Its shares lost a quarter of their value on the opening day in what was dubbed “the worst IPO in London’s history” by one of its bankers.
The FCA also proposed cutting the minimum amount of shares to be offered to the public in a listing from 25 per cent to 10 per cent, lower than the 15 per cent threshold Lord Hill had recommended.
The watchdog also wants the minimum market capitalisation for new companies lifted to £50m compared to the previous level of £700,000. Smaller companies would be better supported on specialist growth markets such as Aim and the Aquis Growth Market, rather than the main market, the FCA said.
Delphine Currie, a partner at Reed Smith, the law firm, described the increase in the market cap barrier as “particularly dramatic”.
“The FCA should have looked to raise the threshold in stages as we now risk seeing those companies with a market cap of less than £50m being excluded from a primary listing,” she said.
“While any changes that make the London market more competitive are welcome, many of these proposed reforms may come too late in the day and may be detrimental.”
Authorities are keen to reverse the long-term decline in companies listing on UK stock markets. The number of listed companies in the UK has fallen by about 40 per cent compared to 2008, according to Lord Hill’s listings review, while the UK accounted for only 5 per cent of IPOs globally between 2015-2020. Even so, more than £27bn was raised on the LSE in the first half of the year, its highest total since 2014.
Julia Hoggett, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, had backed reforms and called the consultation “a positive step”. The FCA will consult over the summer and aims to have the rules in place by the end of the year."
The six-billion-dollar man you've probably never heard of,IPOs,"Say hello to the newest member of Italy's super-rich, Andrea Iervolino. He’s a multi-billionaire of sorts.
Iervolino makes films. His producer credits last year included Lamborghini — The Man Behind The Legend, Johnny Puff: Secret Mission, and Tell It Like A Woman (Oscar-nominated in the best original song category). This year’s slate includes Kid Santa, Sherlock Santa and A Day With Santa.
One of Iervolino’s many companies, AMBI Group, launched a $200mn film fund in 2015 shortly after buying remake and sequel rights to hit movies including Donnie Darko, Sliding Doors and Cruel Intentions. Backing came from Raven Capital Management, a New York alternative asset manager known for its esoteric investments.
A year later he irritated the Vatican by announcing that Pope Francis would be appearing as himself in Beyond The Sun, a family adventure based very loosely on the Gospels, and irritated Christopher Nolan fans by announcing a remake of Memento (2000). The latter project hasn’t progressed past development, whereas the Pope Francis film has all but disappeared following an inconspicuous release in 2017.
In addition to making films, Iervolino is an entrepreneur. As founder, CEO and president of Space 11, he intends to put a stadium and TV studios into orbit in 2028 on “the first space station dedicated to entertainment”. The site’s first production, a zero-gravity fighting tournament-cum-reality show called Galactic Combat, is already in the works.
Another of Iervolino’s companies, ILBE, joined Italy’s junior stock market in 2019 then added a secondary listing last year on the growth segment of Euronext Paris. ILBE is a film and TV studio he co-owns with long-term business partner Monika Bacardi, the widow of rum scion Luis Adalberto Facundo Gomez del Campo Bacardi.
ILBE (also known as Iervolino &amp; Lady Bacardi Entertainment) had a market value of €21mn on May 11, most of which stems from two web-friendly cartoon strands, Puffins and Arctic Friends. Here’s the share price chart:
Then there’s Tatatu, a social media app maker that joined Euronext Paris by direct listing last October. Iervolino is its founder and CEO:
Tatatu’s market value peaked in January at €8.5bn and has since drifted back to around €6bn. Iervolino owns 96.5 per cent of the shares via a holding company, IA Media, meaning his personal wealth is hypothetically on par with Miuccia Prada, Piero Ferrari and Silvio Berlusconi.
The company’s eponymous app bundles together a waterfall of short TikTok-style videos and a menu of professionally produced content, most of which comes from ILBE’s roster. Users are rewarded with tokens based on how often they watch, share and interact. These tokens can be used as part-payment for clothes and accessories in a dedicated webstore, or to bid in the two or three in-app auctions that run each day.
On its launch in 2018, Iervolino said that Tatatu would be a blockchain-powered Netflix killer and immediately announced a $575mn private Initial Coin Offering that had apparent celebrity backing:
Tatatu then abandoned crypto. The IPO prospectus makes no mention of blockchain and the ethereum-based TTU tokens it sold in 2018 have no function whatsoever, either inside or outside the app. Their total current value, according to Etherscan data, is nil.
Iervolino’s decision to go public in Paris was to “increase Tatatu’s visibility worldwide” and access capital markets “with the ambition to become one of the world’s must-use social media and entertainment platforms”, he said in October:
I am confident that we will build a vast and loyal TaTaTu community, enhancing social media engagement thanks to our unique proposition and raising social and environmental awareness through original media content.
No new money was raised.
Tatatu’s maiden results showed a €9mn net loss for 2022, which it said was “mainly attributable to the non-recurring costs incurred for the IPO.” Core revenue was €104.8mn — though there’s a very important footnote here about “barter equivalent transactions”.
How it works is that Tatatu (via a Hungarian subsidiary) swaps video rights for advertising space on its platform, then books a cash-equivalent value as revenue using “an accounting policy developed by the company based on the IFRS15 standard”. This can be done as a straight swap or by “barter equivalent”, whereby clients take ad space in exchange for put options to supply videos later. Whichever way, revenue is booked as receivables and squared off against payables, but no money ever has to change hands.
“Barter contracts are necessary to create a library of content to attract users,” a Tatatu spokesman told us. “This methodology has saved money on the purchase of video content. However, as shown in the cash flow statement, these revenues do not generate cash, as the business is financed by equity and bank debt.”
At the time of its flotation, according to the prospectus, Tatatu’s revenues were “entirely related to non-cash advertising based on bartering arrangements in place”.
Five anchor clients are named in Tatatu’s prospectus as making use of these ads-for-content swaps. By far the most important is The Worldwide Production Services LLC (WWPS), a Toronto-based film company that holds digital distribution rights to the ILBE-produced Puffins and Arctic Friends series. The two shows provide the bulk of Tatatu’s professional content — though viewing is blocked in Italy, where Iervolino keeps his interests ringfenced to protect a tax break given to independent film producers.
WWPS was co-founded by Fabio Varlese, an Italian-Canadian doctor specialising in geriatric and internal medicine. He’s on the board of Ambi Gala Foundation, a Canadian charity founded by Iervolino and Bacardi to host A-list fundraisers, is named among the executive producers on the Iervolino-produced crime caper The Ritual Killer (2023), and keeps a framed photo of Iervolino in his office.
Emails to WWPS and to Varlese’s address at The Toronto Clinic, asking about his professional relationship with Iervolino and potential conflicts of interest, received no response. Tatatu’s spokesman said:
Since Iervolino is the producer of some of the content distributed by WWPS and therefore being confident of the quality, he also wanted to enter into a distribution agreement with WWPS [to] ensure these high quality products [are] in the Tatatu platform. This demonstrates confidence and commitment to the quality of the content that the company wants to broadcast.
The structure of the agreement is exactly the same used by the major platforms and by all the other suppliers of Tatatu. Obviously after the initial phase, the offer of video content will be diversified in many providers.
Have we mentioned the food markets yet? We should mention the food markets.
A few months before its float, Tatatu bought a 75-per-cent stake in Mercato Metropolitano, an operator of four Italian-themed London food markets. Iervolino has been adding film studios to its sites in partnership with music producer David Tickle, who is the other co-founder of WWPS.
Mercato Metropolitano's Andrea Rasca last year swapped control of his business for £600,000 cash and a 1-per-cent stake in Tatatu, paid for in newly minted shares. Their agreement put a pre-money value on Tatatu of €1.6bn. Private placements earlier in 2022 had raised just over €5mn from investors including Swiss boutique bank Crédit des Alpes at the same price of €2 per share, which the company said had been set with the help of “a consulting firm of international reputation” it did not name.
Rasca’s sale of Mercato Metropolitano included a clause that if Tatatu floated below the €2 apiece needed to support a €1.6bn valuation, the company would make up the difference by giving him more equity. It wasn’t needed. Tatatu shares joined Euronext at €2 as planned and ended their first trading day at €3.35.
Day two: €7.
Day three: €8.50.
Day four: €10.
But while the stock price soared, volumes dwindled. Daily trading was in the low- to mid-1000s of shares at first sessions then dropped sharply, often to single figures. On more than 40 trading days so far this year, according to Bloomberg data, a single share has changed hands:
All this is fine according to the Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book. To join the junior market a company needs a minimum free float of just €2.5mn and there are no subsequent liquidity tests. Tatatu’s debut value of €1.6bn meant it cleared the free-float hurdle easily, even though 99.39 per cent of its shares were held by directors and connected parties:
Soon after flotation, another slug of stock went to director Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri, a former Fiat boss who became tabloid-famous in 2009 while dating Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.
Tatatu minted new shares in January to give to Anivad Consulting Ltd, a company owned by Teodorani-Fabbri and his wife Davina de Forest (née Cornish). The award was for “certain scouting activities” and was worth €2.65mn at the subscription price of €2 per share, which included a €2.5mn bonus triggered by Tatatu’s flotation. At the time, the market mid-price on Tatatu shares was €8.40.
It's a question that may seem beside the point given all of the above but we'll ask it anyway: what (aside from its chronic lack of free float) might make Tatatu a multibillion-euro company?
Tatatu’s abbreviated full-year results statement in March revealed that 906,000 users had “completed the registration process for Tatatu’s web or mobile app” by the end of 2022, up from 95,000 at the end of January. Its float prospectus identifies non-current assets worth just €14.2mn, mostly intangible, of which €2.5mn is for the app and €4.3mn is for the brand trademark. Its Google Play store listing shows approximately 100,000 downloads and 1,240 reviews, 29 per cent of which are one-star.
A common complaint among users is that tokens are easy to earn but difficult to spend usefully. The same Dsquared2 bum bag that costs $229.24 plus tokens “equivalent to $95.76” in Tatatu’s web store can be ordered from Harrods for £209, for example. Meanwhile, the winning bids on daily auctions have nominal values — $10,250 for a Calvin Klein handbag; $850 for Tatatu-branded earphones; $675 for a sweatshirt signed by actor Gabriel Garko; $11,500 for a mystery box that might contain Tatatu-branded earphones — that suggests a token’s purchasing power is far below its $0.25 face value.
Asked about the strategy around tokens, Tatatu said its discount system “is still in the start-up phase.” Asked for active user metrics, and about increasing share liquidity, Tatatu did not respond. Asked about whether Iervolino had used his Tatatu stake as collateral for personal loans, we were told this was “not an information that is available from company’s management.”
We didn’t ask about Iervolino’s space station, nor his recent investment in Miami FC, since those themes have already been covered adequately by other media.
Iervolino has an agreement in place not to sell any Tatatu shares for two years from the IPO date, so unless the condition is waived he is locked into being a paper billionaire until October 18, 2024. Other insiders have lock-ups lasting until at least October 2025 so, whatever happens from here, everyone should have plenty of time to enjoy Tatatu’s high quality products:

Indonesia’s sovereign wealth fund set to boost spending in year ahead,Indonesia,"Indonesia’s sovereign wealth fund is poised to boost spending this year as the country’s prominent role in the green energy transition and investors’ eagerness to diversify from China push it into the spotlight as an investment destination.
Ridha Wirakusumah, chief executive of the Indonesian Investment Authority (INA), said the two-year-old fund would have deployed $3bn by the end of this year alongside its partners. As of April this year the fund had deployed just over $2bn.
China has long been a top destination for foreign capital in Asia, but, amid rising geopolitical tensions with the US, trade disputes and its lowest growth target in decades, higher growth rates elsewhere have attracted investor attention.
“Indonesia is suddenly becoming a potential investment destination in terms of stability and risk and reward . . . from a country perspective it is hard to ignore now,” said Wirakusumah, a former private sector banker in Indonesia.
Jakarta launched INA in February 2021 with $5bn in seeding in cash and other assets. Its total assets under management are now $8bn.
Unlike most sovereign wealth funds, which typically manage a country’s surplus reserves and invest overseas, INA has raised money from international investors to co-invest in infrastructure, digital and other opportunities within Indonesia.
Since its creation, INA has signed some $28bn in agreements with investors including Singapore’s GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Kuwait Investment Authority, China’s Silk Road Fund and the Netherlands’ APG. Not all of these commitments are binding and some have co-invested in projects, rather than directly into the INA.
INA’s launch, part of a package of reforms spearheaded by President Joko Widodo to boost foreign investment, was seen as a way for major global institutions to access the potentially higher returns offered by south-east Asia’s largest economy.
Its creation has coincided with an investment boom in Indonesia, whose economy grew 5.3 per cent last year. From its huge reserves of nickel and cobalt — crucial materials for electric batteries — to an infrastructure spending spree and a period of sustained political stability, more global investors see the country as an option for diversification.
Wirakusumah, who travelled to Australia this month to meet local superannuation funds, said investors in its southern neighbour had previously ignored Indonesia and south-east Asia. “Indonesia was not on the radar screen . . . and now we [go] there at their invitation and we have specific deals we want to talk about. They want to look into infrastructure, digital, and energy transition.”
As well as other sovereign investors, Jakarta’s fund has signed deals with BlackRock, Allianz and private equity groups. “Pension funds, sovereign funds, insurance companies — all are giving us a lot of interest. We are also talking with private equity firms and other strategic groups,” Wirakusumah said.
Wirakusumah, who formerly worked at Citigroup and was head of Indonesia’s Bank Permata, admitted investors were still careful of a “newish market like Indonesia”, which is still regarded by many as a riskier bet among emerging economies. INA recorded a net profit of Rp2.62tn ($176mn) in 2022. The fund holds cash and bonds, as well as equity stakes in state-owned banks and its investments to date include toll roads and local companies.
Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), Canada’s second-largest public pension fund, agreed to co-invest up to $3.75bn in toll roads with INA alongside APG Asset Management, the biggest pension fund in the Netherlands, and an Abu Dhabi Investment Authority subsidiary in 2021.
“We’ve been very active in Indonesia . . . we’ve looked at a range of things [including] opportunities in data, transport and energy,” said Cyril Cabanes, managing director of infrastructure for Asia-Pacific at CDPQ.
In terms of assets under management and total commitments, the Jakarta fund ranked 42 globally and 18 in Asia-Pacific for 2022, according to Caproasia Institute."
ICE warns it may pull gas market from EU over Brussels price cap,Intercontinental Exchange,"Intercontinental Exchange has warned it may pull its gas trading market out of the Netherlands if Brussels presses ahead with a plan to introduce a cap on prices.
The stark threat comes as tensions among EU ministers rise following a month of divisive talks over a European Commission proposal to cap the derivatives price of gas traded in Amsterdam.
The market, known as the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), is the region’s main centre for trading and setting the price of gas, and has become a symbolic issue as the bloc tries to respond to its broadening energy crisis.
In an effort to quell the rapid rise in energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has implemented a series of measures including mandatory gas storage and consumption reduction targets.But governments from countries including Belgium, Spain and Greece have insisted that a cap on the price of gas is also necessary to protect consumers and industry from the volatile prices. Others, including Germany and the Netherlands, fear a cap would threaten the security of gas supplies and put financial stability at risk because it would put unbearable costs on market users.
On Tuesday, ministers failed for a second time to find a resolution to the debate and have delayed approval of the measure to their final meeting of the year next Monday.
In a memo sent to member states on Thursday, and seen by the Financial Times, ICE warned that the rapid imposition of a cap would give it no time for customers to adapt or for the market operator to test the system’s resilience and risk management systems. A cap would likely force traders to immediately recalculate their prices, risks and costs, putting greater strain on the market, it said.
“As a consequence, it is the responsibility of ICE as the market operator to consider all options if this mechanism is agreed, up to and including whether an effective market in the Netherlands is still viable,” the memo said.
ICE declined to comment further. The exchanges operator, based in Atlanta, has warned a cap could add unsustainable costs to the utility companies and other traders that use it, and force prices for consumers higher.
The EU’s latest proposal would see a cap triggered when TTF futures prices hit €220 per megawatt hour for five days and are €35 per MWh higher than average prices for liquefied natural gas.
Brussels also wants to expand its original plan from including only month-ahead futures contracts to ones that settled three months hence. ICE has warned gas traders would be forced to find another $47bn in margin payments, around double the current levels they pay, if a revised plan went ahead.
The European Central Bank also warned last week that a cap could “in some circumstances, jeopardise financial stability in the euro area”.
The Commission originally proposed a cap of €275 per MWh when prices hit that level for 10 days, and contingent on gas prices being €58 per MWh higher than an average of global LNG prices. Several ministers from pro-price cap countries deemed that level “a joke” as it would not have been triggered even when prices hit record highs in August.
In 2018, ICE transferred trading in hundreds of energy futures contracts from London to the US to help customers escape the burdens of new Mifid II rules governing European financial markets. Last year, it moved EU carbon trading from London to Amsterdam in the wake of Brexit."

Welcome to FT Asset Management, our weekly newsletter on the movers and shakers behind a multitrillion-dollar global industry. This article is an on-site version of the newsletter. Sign up here to get it sent straight to your inbox every Monday.
Does the format, content and tone work for you? Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com
When John Elkann, chair of Stellantis and scion of the billionaire Agnelli industrial dynasty, was looking to build out an asset management business, he naturally turned to James Anderson for advice.
He had known the maverick fund manager for more than a decade, in various capacities. At Baillie Gifford, where Anderson worked for almost four decades, he was a major shareholder in Exor companies including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ferrari. The pair had regularly attended Sun Valley — the so-called summer camp for billionaires — in Idaho, where they would compare notes on philanthropy, entrepreneurship and what it meant to start and build a company in the 21st century.
The discussions have proved rather fruitful. As my colleague Arash Massoudi and I reveal in this scoop, the Agnelli family holding company is backing Anderson’s return to full-time investing a year after retiring from Baillie Gifford.
Lingotto Investment Management, a new $3bn firm that is owned by Exor, has appointed Anderson to its team of investors. He will launch a new fund focused on innovation in both public and private markets, starting with about $500mn in assets.
Elkann told us that his vision for Lingotto was to “provide a home for very talented investment management professionals to join a place which is entrepreneurial and much focused on letting them do what they’re good at and what they love”.&nbsp;
Lingotto is named after the historic Fiat factory in Turin, which was inaugurated in 1923. (Remember its rooftop racetrack that featured in the 1969 film The Italian Job?) It will be chaired by George Osborne, the former UK chancellor who is now a banker at boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw.
Anderson had a stellar tenure running Baillie Gifford’s flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust before a well-timed exit last year. Its performance has soured since then, as the march of growth stocks that are its bread and butter was curbed by higher interest rates.
He acknowledged that “it’s been a difficult 18 months” for growth investing, but said the long-term opportunity in sectors including artificial intelligence, healthcare and renewable energy was greater than ever. Anderson said:
“One of the great puzzles to me is that markets have become so sceptical and short-term at a time when the pace of innovation and change, and the prospects of returns over five, 10 and 20 years, has got greater than less.”&nbsp;
But he has, for now, reluctantly tempered his enthusiasm for investing in China. Anderson said: “Despite the quality of entrepreneurs and businesses we see there, a reconciliation between the US and China seems a long way off and that has implications for investors.”&nbsp;
Read the full story here&nbsp;
Meanwhile, catch up on the Lunch with the FT I did with Anderson last year here. And if you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend this fascinating biographical documentary about Elkann’s grandfather Gianni Agnelli, legendary industrialist, playboy and style icon.
When Robyn Grew was working for Lehman Brothers in London in 1999, Japanese regulators raided the bank as part of an investigation into accusations that it and others had helped financial institutions conceal losses.
Grew was quickly dispatched to Tokyo by Lehman’s top brass to help deal with the bank’s response. She spent the next year flying back and forth between the two capital cities, eventually moving there with her wife for a stint.
The episode reflects several traits that close associates say define Grew: a quick thinker and a natural problem solver, as I explore in this profile of the gregarious former barrister.
Last week she was named incoming chief executive of Man Group, the world’s largest listed hedge fund manager with $144.7bn in assets under management. By the end of this year — and for the first time since it began life in the sugar industry in the late 18th century — Man will be led by two women.
Grew will replace longstanding chief Luke Ellis in September, and former Capital International executive Anne Wade is taking over from investment banker John Cryan as chair.
For 54-year-old Grew, currently the president of Man, the promotion marks the culmination of a 14-year career at the FTSE 250 group that she joined in 2009 as its chief compliance officer. Since then she has held a variety of executive positions in compliance, trading legal and operations.
“I’ve seen her in various avatars . . . she’s quite a force of nature,” said Dev Sanyal, chief executive of Varo Energy and a former non-executive director at Man. “She has a strong compass about who she is and what she does.”
Grew played a central role in Man’s turnround and recovery following its acquisition of GLG Partners for $1.6bn in 2010. It was dubbed a reverse takeover, later written down by more than $1bn and its aftermath was marked by a testing period.
Grew inherits a business in good shape that has evolved from a siloed organisation to a large technology-driven investment group. But she still faces challenges.
Man has set out its stall on being an active investment group, an approach that faces continuous pressure from cheaper passive investing.

The platinum market is expected to chalk up its largest deficit since records began in the 1970s as supply falters in South Africa and China’s industrial expansion powers ahead, writes Harry Dempsey in London.
Global platinum demand is forecast to surge 28 per cent this year to 8.2mn ounces after investors piled in, adding to strong industrial consumption and increasing use of the metal in car catalytic converters in the first quarter, according to the World Platinum Investment Council, an industry body.
At the same time, ailing output, exacerbated by stuttering electricity supply in top producer South Africa, has pushed the WPIC to revise its deficit forecast up 77 per cent from three months ago, to 983,000 ounces this year.
“It would be a record deficit in ounces since records going back to the 1970s,” said Edward Sterck, director of research at WPIC. He added that the last time that 12 per cent of demand could not be met by new supply and recycling was 1999.
Howard Marks, the co-founder of $172bn investment group Oaktree Capital Management, has warned that the boom in private credit will soon be tested as higher interest rates and slower economic growth heap pressure on corporate America.
Big investors have sounded the alarm over the record-breaking rush of company share buybacks, warning the exercise may do little to help shareholders and can be “manipulated” by corporate executives to boost bonuses.
Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, says the alternatives giant is in discussions with large US regional banks about providing them with extra firepower to lend to companies amid signs the recent industry turmoil is morphing into a credit crunch.

"Investors dump mutual funds for equities too, not only ETFs",Investing in funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools
US investors are deserting mutual funds in their droves, but while exchange traded funds have been beneficiaries the largest swing in recent years has been to individual stocks, new research shows.
For example, 57 per cent of the discretionary investments held by millennials (born 1981-1996) was in mutual funds in 2018. By 2022 that proportion had shrunk to 40 per cent. The biggest gain was felt in direct equity holdings, which rose from 19 per cent of the average portfolio in 2018 to 33 per cent in 2022. ETFs enjoyed a smaller gain, moving from 24 per cent to 27 per cent.
A similar picture emerges for baby boomers (born 1946-1964). Mutual funds accounted for 54 per cent of their discretionary investments in 2018, but this shrank to 41 per cent in 2022. ETFs rose from 19 per cent to 22 per cent, but equities saw the biggest increase, jumping from 27 per cent in 2018 to 36 per cent in 2022.
“Right now and for the last two decades ETFs have been a primary driver of the erosion in active mutual funds. Over this same period, separately managed accounts (SMA) using individual equities have also been quite popular . . . this trend is poised to continue,” said Andrew Guillette, vice-president, global insights at Broadridge.
He noted that separate Broadridge research showed there had been a swing to both passive investment and to the ETF wrapper. Specifically, between 2018 and 2022 active mutual funds had suffered outflows of $1.8tn, while passive index mutual funds had inflows of $489mn. Over the same period passive ETFs had $1.9tn in inflows, while active ETFs had inflows of $253mn.
But he added that direct equity holdings too were benefiting from an industry trend towards more personalised portfolios. “ETFs comprise 50 per cent of assets in model portfolios and have grown at a much faster rate inside models than active mutual funds,” Guillette said. “Besides the trends towards SMAs, we are in the early days of equities-based direct indexing made possible by fintech advancements,” he added.
Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, said the flood of capital outside retirement accounts from mutual funds to ETFs had been well documented.
“The bigger surprise is the increase in equities holdings by retail investors,” he said. “Investors’ penchant for stocks likely comes from two very different developments — the boom in new investor retail accounts during the Covid-19 pandemic and portfolio customisation for wealthier investors.”
He noted, however, that initial interest in custom indexing, which allows investors to tailor indices to their personal goals, had started to subside.
“As it currently stands, most investors don’t stand to gain much from this level of customisation,” he said. He noted that while this approach offered advantages in tax-loss harvesting, when investors realise losses to offset gains, the added costs could not compete with the general tax efficiency offered by ETFs.
However, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, said he expected growth in both customisation and ETFs to continue.
“Investors have more access to customised individual stock portfolios and ETFs than in the past and no longer need to rely on expensive and one-size-fits-all active mutual funds,” he said. “Direct indexing and ETFs will continue to gain traction as a younger generation accumulates more wealth.”"
M&G European tracker fund closure leaves investors exposed to CGT hit,Investing in funds,"The planned closure of a small tracker fund has highlighted some big potential tax headaches for UK retail investors.
M&amp;G Investments told clients in April that it would shut its European Index Tracker Fund at the end of next month, closing a modest £98mn fund, which managers have decided is too small to be viable.
About 80 per cent of the fund’s investors hold their stakes through tax-efficient Isas and will have the option of switching tax-free to another M&amp;G fund or a different provider.
But that does not help an FT reader, who is questioning M&amp;G’s move, because his stake is held outside an Isa or other tax-wrapper.
“I’ve effectively been kicked out and it shows that there’s no controlling investment managers,” says the retired art historian. “The fund hasn’t performed well, it has charged high fees, and now they’ve pulled the plug. It’s outrageous.”
The move highlights an issue that could affect investors holding similarly small funds that might be closed in ways that force some savers to crystallise capital gains — and so incur a tax liability.
The FT reader, who asked not to be named, bought about £100,000 worth of shares as a “core holding” at the turn of the millennium. This grew to more than £450,000 by the time he was informed of the fund’s closure. He calculates a looming capital gains tax bill of about £54,000 and has little time to reduce his liability.
Morningstar data shows that nearly 4,500 open-ended funds have merged or closed since 2013. The vast majority were liquidated and some analysts argue that the rate of consolidation is only going to accelerate.
“Regulatory changes forced asset managers to assess value for money, and it would be very hard for a board to continue to approve something so ‘vanilla’ with such a relatively high fee,” said Holly Mackay, chief executive of Boring Money, a financial website for consumers. “I suspect we will see more closures ahead as regulatory scrutiny steps up.”
The Financial Conduct Authority’s new consumer duty, scheduled for implementation at the end of July, will require companies to take “appropriate action” to avoid causing “foreseeable harm and provide fair value”. This builds on previous rules around value assessments.
M&amp;G’s 2021-22 fund value assessment report said the closing fund’s performance must improve but its board judged that its two share classes could be rated “good” and “satisfactory”. It also concluded “necessary actions” had been taken to meet objectives.
Though M&amp;G did lower fees on the fund from about 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent a few years ago, Mackay says this is still “hefty” for a tracker fund when others charge about 0.1 per cent. Our reader approximates that he paid some £35,000 in fees to M&amp;G on the fund over two decades.
I suspect we will see more closures ahead as regulatory scrutiny steps up
One boutique fund manager, who did not wish to be named, says M&amp;G would have weighed up the possible reputation hit when deciding to close the fund, but still could have explored a merger with another fund or possible sale to another fund manager.
M&amp;G said: “We considered a range of options but as an active asset manager, the only alternative passive M&amp;G fund available was not suitable given it tracks the FTSE All-Share index, which offers significantly different geographical, sector and currency exposure to investors.”
“For those who invested directly with a fund manager, I’m afraid that you will often find yourself in a cul-de-sac with no way out other than to sell if they decide to close a fund,” says Mackay. She adds that this position can be offset by switching out of general holdings into an Isa, a process known as “Bed and Isa”, up to the £20,000 tax-free annual allowance.
If a fund does close on an unprepared investor, the options to offset the CGT bill are limited. Nimesh Shah, chief executive of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, says individuals can defer capital gains through investing in a tax-efficient Enterprise Investment Scheme fund. But these are risky investments in early stage companies.
Shah instead advises savers to move quickly to crystallise gains, buying more time to stow away the amount due to HM Revenue &amp; Customs in a tax deposit account that earned interest.
This is little relief to the FT reader who had hoped to sell over several years to minimise his CGT liability. But other savers can still try to plan ahead for unexpected closures."
Which DIY investment platform is best for me?,Investing in funds,"FT Money wants to hear from readers who are considering which DIY investment platform is best for them — or those who are frustrated by the service they are getting and thinking of a change.
As high UK inflation erodes the value of your cash and uncertainty clouds the outlook for financial markets, you may be seeking out a better return on your investments.
DIY platforms can reduce the costs of investing compared with a full-scale wealth management offering. But there is no free lunch. You may be wondering whether a platform that charges a percentage is right for you, or one that levies a flat fee. Do you expect to trade stocks often or move money between funds? If you do, which are the cheapest and easiest options?
DIY platforms won’t offer you investment advice, but may point you in the direction of funds they think are worth considering. How useful do you find this guidance? And most customers like to hold their investments in tax-efficient Isa accounts. Is it straightforward to set one up or transfer from another provider, without a long administrative delay?

The search for a better investment recipe,Investments,"Anybody who has tried to bake a cake will know there are lots of things that can go wrong, from burnt tops to soggy bottoms. And that can even happen when bakers are trying to follow a recipe.
When it comes to assembling an investment portfolio, there is no set of instructions guaranteed to deliver success, since we cannot forecast the future with any certainty. To pursue the analogy, the same approach might produce a rich chocolate cake in one climate, but an inedible mess in another.
Instead of an exact formula, investors tend to be guided by vague aphorisms, or rules of thumb. A classic example is the instruction to diversify, not simply in the sense of owning a wide range of shares, but in different asset classes, or across different countries.
But investors can be forgiven for wanting a bit more precision. After all, since the turn of the millennium, there have been crashes in internet stocks (which many people thought were the best hope for the future); US houses (which many thought would never fall in price); and, most recently, the collapse of several well-established American banks (which many believed were too well run to get into difficulties).
One of the oldest rules of thumb is the 60/40 split, with 60 per cent of the portfolio in equities and the remainder in government bonds. The idea is that equities will provide growth and government bonds income while the steadiness of the bond portion of the portfolio will make up for the volatility of the equities.
But even this principle is now under challenge. The BlackRock investment institute, the research arm of the fund management giant, said that the 60/40 model would not work well in coming years, since central banks were likely to be vigilant in combating inflation. “We don’t see the return of a joint stock-bond bull market” the institute said.
When the world’s largest institutional investor questions a commonly-held principle, it’s time to take notice. Even retail investors, who often don’t have the time or expertise to follow every twist in the market, should look at their portfolios in a new light.
The 60-40 proportions have always been a bit arbitrary. Benjamin Graham, mentor of the great investor Warren Buffett, suggested a 50/50 split. But such simple rules also have their merits. If maintained over time, investors will need to rebalance their portfolios; selling those assets which have risen most sharply in price and buying those which have underperformed.
Implicit in these approaches is the idea that equities and bonds perform well in different economic conditions. Equities do best when the economy is growing, and corporate profits are rising. They tend to suffer during (or just before) economic recessions as investors anticipate falling profits. A classic example was the financial crisis of 2008-09 which was accompanied by a deep recession, and led to a deep equity bear market.
The income and repayment values of most bonds are fixed, so investors suffer when inflation is high and the real value of the asset declines. During the period 1970-1981, when British inflation was sometimes in double-digits, investors in UK government bonds, or gilts, lost 43.5 per cent of their money in real terms.
On occasions, however, equities and bonds can lose money at the same time. That is what happened in 2022 when the S&amp;P 500 index and long-term US Treasury bonds both suffered double-digit percentage declines. A sudden rise in inflation forced central banks around the world to push up interest rates. Bonds were hit by inflation and equity prices were damaged by fears that higher rates would lead to recession.
Over the long term, the correlation between equities and bonds has been far from stable (see graph). In the 1980s and 1990s, both equities and government bonds rose in price, a positive correlation that was great news for investors. The correlation was negative in the first two decades of the 21st century, which was still useful. But a prolonged period in which both equities and bonds fall in price, as happened in the 1970s as well as 2022, would be disastrous.
Valuations are a particular problem at the moment. Investment return comes in two forms. Income results from the payment of interest (on bonds and cash), rent (on property) and dividends (on equities). Capital gains occur as assets rise in price. The biggest capital gains come from equities and property, but short-run capital gains can be earned on bonds, particularly if their price is below their repayment, or maturity, value.
A key valuation measure is the yield, or the income from an asset, divided by the price. As the income is constant (in the short run), as asset prices rise, yields fall. That is exactly what happened in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. At the end of 1981, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 12.6 per cent while the yield on the S&amp;P 500 index was 5.4 per cent. By the end of 2020, the 10-year Treasury bond yielded just 1.1 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 index 1.6 per cent. While dividends grew, asset prices rose much faster. In effect, investors had a strong tailwind aiding their progress.
But this process must eventually run out of road. The income from both asset classes has become so low that investors are largely relying on capital gains. In theory, investing at a time when yields are high, means that the expected return will also be high. Conversely, when yields are low, returns are also likely to be disappointing. Although yields rose in 2022, they are still low by historic standards; the 10-year Treasury bond yields 3.4 per cent and the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 index just 1.7 per cent.
This causes some to be pessimistic about the outlook. Antti Ilmanen of the US investment firm AQR, is well known for his analysis of the components of long-term returns. In his 2022 book Investing Amid Low Expected Returns, he argued that investors had benefited from windfall gains in almost all asset classes over multiple decades as real yields fell and asset valuations rose.
The bad news, wrote the 61-year-old quantitative investment specialist, was that “harsher investment conditions are ahead” whether it be the “slow pain” of low income returns or “the fast pain of losses when rich asset valuations revert to more normal levels”.&nbsp;
If he is right, investors have a problem: a 60/40 equity-bond portfolio is no use if both asset classes are likely to deliver disappointing returns. Ilmanen and BlackRock suggest similar solutions. First, invest in a wider range of assets. Second, be more selective within the two main asset categories.
The two other traditional asset classes are cash and property. After years of earning barely any interest on their accounts, UK savers can now get 3-4 per cent if they shop around. Given that inflation is still over 10 per cent in Britain, such returns are very negative in real terms. Having some cash is always useful to meet sudden financial commitments. But it is hard to make the case for it as a substantial part of a long-term portfolio.
Many retail investors will already have a substantial property exposure through home ownership. Some may have an even bigger interest via the buy-to-let market. Residential property is generally seen as a good hedge against inflation. But rising interest rates are bad news for those who have borrowed money to buy property, and houses already look expensive. Nationwide, the building society, compares UK house prices for first-time buyers to their earnings; in the first quarter of 2023, that ratio was 5.4, close to its record high, and compared with a 40-year average of 3.8.
Commercial property also struggles when interest rates are rising. Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime associate, recently observed that “a lot of real estate isn’t so good any more”. Office blocks have been hit by the trend of working from home, while shopping malls have been badly affected by internet shopping. Property funds face a mismatch between the illiquidity of their portfolios and the ability to allow redemptions; there was a rush to withdraw money last autumn from such funds after the UK government’s disastrous “mini” Budget. On occasions, funds have had to halt redemptions.
Commodity futures have offered a historic return of 3 per cent over cash, according to Ilmanen. But this is true of a diversified basket; individual commodities are highly volatile. This is a risky area of the market which small investors lack the expertise to exploit.
As for cryptocurrencies, the Financial Conduct Authority points out that many “have no tangible assets that sit behind them”, that it is a largely unregulated market in which scammers are increasingly active, and that investors “should be prepared to lose all your money”.
Institutional investors have been increasingly enthusiastic in recent decades about “alternative assets”, such as private equity funds which invest in companies that are not quoted on the stock market. The claim is that private companies can operate more efficiently when not under the scrutiny focused on listed companies.
The long-term performance of private equity funds is extremely good, beating the S&amp;P 500 index. But the sector may struggle to match this record in future. There is now a much smaller valuation gap between private and publicly quoted companies and more competition for target companies, making bargains harder to find.
In any case, it is hard for the average saver to invest directly in a private equity fund, as the minimum amounts needed are substantial. Venture capital trusts are accessible and have attractive tax breaks, but they need to be held for at least five years. And there are obviously risks involved in devoting a large part of the portfolio to young, unquoted companies.
Alternative assets are either too risky or out of reach for the average retail saver.
So the best option for small investors might involve being more selective within the main asset categories. If overall returns are going to be lower, then seeking out the most likely source of positive real returns seems sensible. Index-linked gilts are bonds issued by the UK government whose repayment value and annual interest rates are linked to inflation. Counter-intuitively, they performed poorly in 2022, even though inflation rose sharply.
Why was that? For many years, index-linked gilts were highly sought after by pension funds. This drove the price up and the yield down. The yield was so low that in real terms it was negative. This corrected sharply last year as gilts fell in price and real yields are now more appealing. A recent sale of index-linked gilts, maturing in 2045, offered a yield 0.65 per cent above the annual increase in the retail price index. At least, if held till maturity, that is a positive real return.
Within equities, it may be possible to enhance returns by following a particular investment “style”. The best known is value investing, which aims to buy stocks that look cheap relative to various measures, such as the company’s assets, profits or sales. This tactic had a very good long-term record until the 2010s when it performed dismally as everyone piled into technology stocks, which are prized for their potential growth not their cheapness. Value did make a comeback in 2022 and Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, an investment firm, says that there’s “ample room for value to perform brilliantly in this decade”.
Other opportunities to enhance returns may occasionally arise. The spread, or excess interest rate, paid by the issuers of riskier corporate bonds (usually dubbed high yield) was very high in the early 2000s, during the financial crisis of 2008-09 and at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Those turned out to be good times for bargain hunting. Sadly, spreads are not particularly high at the moment. “If you’re concerned about the possibility of recession, these current valuations in investment-grade credits aren’t very appealing,” says Alfonzo Bruno of Morningstar Investment Management.
Another option is emerging market equities. The stock markets of developing countries performed extremely well in the early years of the millennium but crashed during the financial crisis. After another bad year in 2022, the MSCI Emerging Markets index is lower than it was before the 2008 crisis. At the start of this year, emerging market equities traded on a 35 per cent discount to developed markets on a price-earnings basis, according to Lazard Asset Management, and offered a dividend yield of 3.3 per cent versus developed markets’ 2.1 per cent.
To sum up, it may be worth combining a strategic asset allocation rule with tactical flexibility. Dividing the portfolio between equities and bonds will depend on the investor’s risk appetite and their view on the likelihood of inflation remaining high. Cautious investors who think inflation will subside will want more in bonds; more aggressive investors will want more in equities. Regular rebalancing will be needed, however, to keep the allocations close to the target.
Within those allocations, investors may at times want to have more in categories such as index-linked bonds or emerging markets if they seem to offer good bargains by historical standards. After all, a good chef knows how to improvise when they don’t have all the right ingredients."
There’s a new high flier at JPMorgan,JPMorgan Chase & Co,"After nearly two decades at the helm of the US’s biggest bank by assets, Jamie Dimon is (as FT dep ed Patrick Jenkins wrote this week) the de facto King of Wall Street.
The JPMorgan boss certainly lives the life of a modern-day financial monarch, which naturally involves racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars of personal jet spending on the company dime.
Here’s how his personal use of corporate aircraft spending has stacked up over recent years, according to JPM’s proxy filings (these refer to the prior year, so eg the 2021 edition covers 2020’s flying):
Putting aside the climate impact of all those air miles, these are simply pretty big money numbers by most regular humans’ standards, although not by the standard of Dimon’s overall compensation or broader US corporate standards. Call it the royal prerogative.
What’s mildly interesting, however, is that Dimon now has a rival within JPM.
When Team Dimon stepped in to acquired First Republic Bank at the start of this month — bringing the US’s second-biggest banking failure to close — they acquired $93.5bn of deposits, $30bn of securities, $173bn of loans, a slew of branches, and one extremely flight-happy chairman.
James H. Herbert, II founded First Republic in the mid-1980s, spending 37 years as its chief executive before shifting to the role of executive chairman last year.
Per First Republic’s own proxy filings (which it files with the FDIC, rather than the SEC), Herbert treasures his non-commercial aircraft expenses even more than Dimon:
FT Alphaville finds it hard to figure out why the boss of a regional US bank needed to fly so much more than the boss of the biggest lender in the world’s biggest economy, and particularly so much during the first year of the pandemic. Perhaps we’re just unimaginative.
Either way, First Republic’s collapse means we didn’t get a new proxy statement this year — and it’s not clear if we’ll ever again find out such specifics about Herbert’s flight spending. But we have to assume he’ll be getting his wings clipped — it’s never wise to overshadow the king.

Japan stock index hits 33-year high as investors warm to Tokyo story,Japanese business & finance,"Japan’s stocks reached their highest level in 33 years on Tuesday, propelled by growing hopes of higher governance standards and more serious regard for shareholders after decades of lacklustre returns.
The broad Topix index rose almost 0.6 per cent on Tuesday, taking gains so far this year to 13.9 per cent and close to its highest level since Japan’s notorious market bubble burst in the final days of 1989. The Nikkei 225 index has gained more than 16 per cent since the start of the year and is again close to a post-bubble high, making Japan one of the hottest markets in the world.
Foreign investors have ploughed into stocks and futures in the past five weeks, with net inflows during the period reaching nearly $30bn, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), some of the largest inflows of the past decade.
As well as excitement over the potential for a historic rebalancing of corporate priorities, investors also said Japan was benefiting from a “not-China” trade, a perception that Tokyo was a safe way of gaining exposure to Chinese growth but with less geopolitical risk.
The interest in Japan comes after multiple false dawns and years of anaemic returns that persuaded many fund managers to stay clear of Japan and its tricky corporate structures, particularly with rich returns available elsewhere.
In the time it has taken Japanese stocks to recover from the 1989 crash, US equities have risen more than 10-fold.
However, some are warming to the notion that Tokyo’s stock market is now a trove of high-earning, undervalued stocks, with an accelerating wave of improvements in corporate governance.
Shrikant Kale, Japan equity strategist at Jefferies, said he had not seen so much foreign investor interest in Japan since the early days of the “Abenomics” era in 2012, when Shinzo Abe took office as prime minister and promised market-oriented reforms alongside efforts to pep up the moribund economy.
Adding to the momentum was a rare visit to Japan by Warren Buffett last month, when the US investor made clear he was keen on adding to his portfolio of Japanese investments.
At the same time, Japan stands out as a large developed Asian market that should benefit from China’s economic recovery without the geopolitical risks overshadowing its superpower neighbour, particularly in relation to Taiwan, said multiple fund managers.
Japan may perhaps be “the best not-China option for a global investor”, Kale said.
“Some investors think that Japanese companies have a big exposure to the upside in China but also that you can own them as a hedge against the geopolitical risk,” said Yunosuke Ikeda, chief Japan equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
Many Japanese companies offer exposure to China through exports or because they stand to benefit hugely from Chinese travel to Japan.
Japan’s relatively predictable policymaking also gives it an edge over China, where regulatory crackdowns can be rapid and harmful, said some investors.
“Japan occupies an interesting place geopolitically, and it’s not lost on investors that the rule of law is taken seriously and the corporate governance regime is quite favourable to owners of equities,” said Carl Vine, co-head of the Asia-Pacific equity team at M&amp;G Investments.
Despite the stated optimism of many investors and the momentum behind the current rally, the “buy Japan” theme has yet to produce a sustained reallocation of assets. In Bank of America’s latest survey of global fund managers, released on Tuesday and covering a survey period in early May, respondents were a net 11 per cent underweight Japan, down 1 percentage point from the previous survey.
But evidence of momentum towards improving Japanese companies’ governance and their dealings with shareholders is pulling investment into Japanese stocks.
In recent months, Hiromi Yamaji, the new head of Japan Exchange Group, which controls the TSE, suggested the bourse intended to take a stronger position in pushing companies to raise their corporate value.
Companies need to pay closer attention to their price-to-book ratio, share price and capital cost, he told Japanese media, declaring that he was “not satisfied” with the way many listed companies had implemented the 2015 governance code.
“The [TSE] theme is resonating with a lot of overseas investors and they are starting to see evidence of that on the ground,” said Bruce Kirk, chief Japan equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. Pushed into action by these shifts at the exchange, many companies are buying back shares, untangling often confusing cross-shareholdings and engaging more closely with shareholders before their regular public meetings, Kirk said.
Buybacks announced across corporate Japan surged to an all-time high of ¥9.7tn ($71.4bn) in the financial year that ended in March.
Analysts forecast that companies will set a new record for buybacks by the end of May ahead of an annual meeting season where managements will be under more intense pressure to demonstrate that they are heeding the Tokyo exchange’s recent comments.
Jeff Atherton, head of Japanese equities at hedge fund group Man GLG, said the exchange’s encouragement meant “more has happened with this in the last two years than in the last 30”, creating the biggest single reason for stocks’ upbeat performance.
The exchange “has a determined attitude to driving up returns on equity”, said Atherton. “They want market capitalisations to go up.” Authorities can see that “in the top 500 companies in the world, very, very few are Japanese, and that hurts their ability to compete”, he added.
Buffett’s visit stirred up attention, but overseas investors said it did not change the country’s improving fundamental backdrop.
“It’s not Warren Buffett turning up that makes it interesting. He is observing what others are observing,” said M&amp;G’s Vine. “I’m very excited” by the outlook, he added."
How Japan got its swagger back,Japanese economy,"Late on Thursday afternoon, around the time that Joe Biden was saluting officers at Iwakuni Marine base and Rishi Sunak was leaving for Hiroshima from an exclusive business club in Tokyo, investors around the world received a research note entitled Japan’s Rising Sun.
The timing of the analysis, written by the chief economist at the Bank of Singapore and reviving a metaphor that has promised so much and so often disappointed, seemed perfect.
A confluence of factors, say investors, has made the place more interesting than it has been for some time. They can point to reasons why this time might, finally, be different. Japan is at last allowing itself — and being granted — some swagger. The question, as always, is how long the phenomenon will last.
For now, at least, the momentum is strong. A few hours before Japan’s Rising Sun hit inboxes, the broad Topix index of Japanese stocks had hit a fresh 33-year high on a rally driven by an exceptional six straight weeks of buying by foreign institutions.
Some of that has been drawn to the general promise of accelerating governance reform, but a lot of it is because of what is arguably the biggest practical and psychological change in the Japanese economy for decades. A country where an entire generation of consumers, businesses, banks and political leaders knew only flat or falling prices now has sustained inflation.
Analysts at Bank of America have begun explaining to clients how, on a longer timeframe, the Topix could rise a further 33 per cent to exceed the level that has not, for the majority of many brokers or investors, seemed remotely attainable: its absolute peak in the final days of Japan’s 1980s asset bubble.
The buzz is primed to intensify. On Thursday evening, hundreds of fund managers, representing an estimated $20tn of assets under management and drawn to the promise of stock market reform and a shift in corporate behaviour, began arriving for the Citic CLSA Japan Forum and the first big conference of its type in Tokyo since the pandemic.
Their arrival coincided with a string of announcements that the world’s biggest chipmakers — TSMC, Samsung, Micron and Intel among them — were in discussions that could result in significant manufacturing coming back to Japan as a direct result of economic security concerns and the global redrawing of supply chains.
And, as an anti-China consensus beds-in in Washington and elsewhere, Japan’s current sunrise is also geopolitical. In his hometown of Hiroshima on Thursday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida welcomed leaders of the G7 nations for a summit that gives Japan the increasingly rare chance to be the biggest representative of Asia at any given table. Japan visibly relishes both that and the role of international host, say visiting diplomats, and has extended the scope of the summit by including leaders from South Korea, India, Brazil and Vietnam.
Kishida, say officials, has positioned Japan as a stable, stalwart and supply-chain friendly partner of the west in a region now increasingly defined by China-US decoupling, military tensions and bloc formation for a new cold war. The announcement of an in-person visit to Hiroshima by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy — one of his highest profile foreign excursions since the Russian invasion — helps lock-in that image.
And as the Bank of Singapore note confirms, the G7 leaders find Kishida at the helm of an economy in what some of the visiting heads of governments might consider an enviable shape.
Broader economic activity has been recovering firmly since the start of 2023. Data for the first quarter of the year showed gross domestic product expanding at an annualised, forecast-beating rate of 1.6 per cent. Wages are finally increasing modestly but decisively after years of stagnation.
After decades of deflation, core inflation in April was 3.4 per cent compared with a year earlier and has now been running above the Bank of Japan’s targeted 2 per cent for 13 straight months: high by local standards, but still well under control.
The strength of the Japanese economy, says Stefan Angrick, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, is often underestimated but has arguably always lain in its stability. In a world of increasing turmoil, he says, Japan’s mix of lowish growth and stability “is a feature, not a bug”.
The harshest questions, though, will be asked after everyone has left: when the G7 leaders are gone and the investors are back home looking at the historic charts of fizzled “Japan’s rising sun” rallies and struggling to convince themselves that this time is different. Japan, meanwhile, will be back in a reality where China is still by far its biggest trading partner, its population is shrinking faster than anyone expected and its companies are geared to global growth at a time when many economists fear global recession.
The 500 or so international investors expected to attend next week’s CLSA event will be given a number of good reasons to hope that — in the context of Japanese stocks at least — the sun will keep rising in a way it has not for more than three decades.
Large funds, such as Elliott and Citadel, have said since the start of the year that they are either opening offices in Tokyo or expanding their coverage of Japan at home.
An April visit to Tokyo by Warren Buffett intensified global investor focus on Japan. Berkshire Hathaway’s investments in five Japanese stocks make Tokyo its largest market destination outside the US. At the fund’s May 6 annual meeting, Buffett reassured his audience that he was “not done” with his search for more investable targets there.
One reason for why investor interest has so strongly revived is that managements in Japan are now under unambiguous and unavoidable pressure to engage with shareholders in a way they were not before.
This year the newly installed head of JPX, the group which owns the Tokyo Stock Exchange, outlined a decisive shift in stance. Hiromi Yamaji publicly rued the fact that more than half of TSE stocks were trading below their book value. He suggested that the exchange would support mechanisms that would cajole companies into improving corporate value, rewarding shareholders and paying greater attention to their cost of capital — three changes investors had largely given up hope of seeing.
Masashi Akutsu, chief Japan equity strategist of Bank of America, believes that by picking on low price-to-book, Yamaji had in effect created a formalised metric of shame for managements to live in fear of.
“Investors are asking me whether the TSE’s plan will work without punishment and I say yes, it will. When the corporate governance code was introduced in 2015 it was a time of deflation and companies had little motivation to dramatically change their behaviour. This time the economic situation is different,” he says, noting how radically the return of inflation to Japan after such a long absence had shifted the scenery.
At the same time, shareholder activism has also evolved to sit more comfortably in the mainstream of Japan investment. The number of activist funds in the country has risen from under 10 in 2014 to nearly 70 this year. Between 2015 and 2022, notes Masatoshi Kikuchi, chief equity strategist at Mizuho Securities, the number of shareholder proposals submitted by activists in Japan rose from below five to nearly 60.
This year’s June AGM season, he says, is on track to smash records in terms of proposals. But as many others note, the proposals themselves may be less significant than the more general fear that once docile domestic pension funds and institutional investors will vote against managements for any number of governance-related infractions common across corporate Japan.
The comments from the TSE, along with the greater presence of Japanese activists, has forced what Adrian Gornall, a veteran Tokyo broker and head of investment advisory at Astris in Tokyo, describes as a “total change” in how companies talk and behave.
“I think that a lot of it has to do with who is driving the push on governance. Japan has a resistance to things when they feel forced on it from outside; that was the case before when it was foreign activists pushing companies for these improvements,” he says. “Now there is more Japanese ownership of the idea itself — the idea that companies need to have better capital efficiency, governance — that idea can now be thought of as owned by Japan now.”
Two further factors are also in play, say analysts. One is that the reshaping of global supply chains to build-in a distance from China could unleash a wave of foreign acquisitions of Japanese manufacturers and facilities. The other is that the Japanese market itself may be benefiting directly from what some investors describe as the “not China” trade — a hunt for investable, liquid ways to gain exposure to China without the risk of being directly invested there.
Geopolitical uncertainty around China, says Christopher Willcox, head of wholesale banking at Nomura, “is very good for Japan: the fourth-largest economy in the world, very deep investable markets, and world-class companies. It’s the obvious place where international investors, if they want to have exposure to Asia, will invest over the next five to 10 years.”
The problem with the “rising sun” thesis is that, in several cycles and across multiple decades, it has been rapidly followed by a decisive reversal as concerns around the shrinking and ageing population have resurfaced and derailed brief spurts of optimism.
Rallies are always strongest in Japan when there is a pro-reform regime in government and a perception that there will be action as well as words, say analysts at Morgan Stanley. It is still not completely clear that Kishida can deliver both.
In the meantime, there are a number of reasons to question the sustainability of the stock rally. As brokers point out, major global fund managers, as canvassed by the BofA monthly survey, remain underweight Japan. The recent six weeks of net buying has nowhere near offset the huge selling that persisted for most of the past six years.
Brokers point out that the buying spree that has propelled the Topix to its 33-year high has been passive money buying the whole index rather than active money seeking out the sort of stocks that represent particularly good value or likely activist targets.
“Global fund allocation has not actually changed,” says one broker at a Japanese house eager to see if CLSA’s conference will make a difference, and start the inflows of active money. “Will it change? Maybe. I wish them luck.”

Hong Kong counsels seek better crypto protections,Legal services,"Late last year, Jonathan Crompton, Hong Kong-based partner at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, advised a medical professional based in South Asia who fell victim to crypto fraud after a seemingly innocuous WhatsApp message from a Hong Kong number.
Perpetrators of the scam used Hong Kong phone numbers to strike up virtual friendships with victims, gain their trust, and then ask them to deposit funds into accounts on fake cryptocurrency exchanges. The scammers eventually stopped replying to messages, but not before persuading victims to convince their friends and family to deposit funds with the fake platform, too, explains Crompton.
He says the victim he worked with, and that person’s friends, lost a “large portion” of what they thought they had invested. “I know some very intelligent, sensible people that have fallen victim to scams, but they all have the same response, which is: how could I?” he adds.
Scams involving cryptocurrencies have ballooned in recent years. Hong Kong witnessed 2,336 crypto-related scams in 2022, up 67 per cent from the year before, according to police figures. The frauds involved funds worth HK$1.7bn ($217mn) — a 106 per cent increase on 2021.
While the full scale of the problem is hard to quantify accurately, says Crompton, the number “just keeps going up”.
For lawyers in Hong Kong, addressing fears over the potential for digital assets to enable scams and fraud is a key concern. They are also helping the territory’s Securities and Futures Commission tread the fine line between protecting investors and allowing crypto groups enough freedom to make the city attractive as a base.
But Hong Kong’s balancing act comes as rival jurisdictions have sought to increase their scrutiny of the sector, following several high-profile crypto-business collapses — such as the multibillion implosion of exchange FTX, and the bankruptcies of the lending unit of broker Genesis Digital and the Singaporean hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.
In September, just before Hong Kong launched a high-profile crypto push, RPC’s Crompton became a founding committee member of the territory’s Crypto Fraud and Asset Recovery Network. This group brings together lawyers, accountants and industry players to raise awareness of crypto fraud in Asia. The lawyers also seek to help victims to reclaim their stolen assets.
That second task is more difficult, says Crompton. In traditional finance, “you tend to know who the bad guys are”, he notes. But crypto fraudsters employ aliases to hide their identities and digital wallets used to store defrauded cryptocurrency are usually anonymous.
Additionally, crypto exchanges often fail to react to legal letters notifying them of suspicious activity whereas traditional banks generally would, points out Crompton.
“I don’t think it’s right to say that exchanges don’t understand,” he says. “A lot of the bigger [crypto] exchanges have very good lawyers in them. I think they’re just overwhelmed with the number of letters they’ve received.”
In theory, courts can require exchanges to reverse transactions. But there is a lack of precedent in completing that process and it can be technically difficult or impossible to force the return of cryptocurrencies. Also, many victims of crypto fraud are already short of funds, meaning most clients are unwilling or unable to take cases to their conclusion.
“We’re looking for somebody who has additional finances and is prepared to go after the assets that they’ve lost,” he says, “and, at the moment, we just haven’t really found that victim who is prepared to potentially throw good money after bad on that.”
One solution he suggests is that several clients could pool assets to create joint entities and share the proceeds of any winnings from recovery proceedings.
Gary Tiu, head of regulatory affairs at BC Technology Group, the parent company of OSL — one of just two crypto exchanges to receive a licence from Hong Kong’s financial regulator — believes the city’s crypto push will encourage more investors to use licensed platforms, which should make sure they are better protected from scams, hacks or theft.
But, he warns, the regulatory push could incentivise some retail investors to use riskier, unlicensed exchanges outside Hong Kong’s regulatory remit. There is also a risk, he adds, that publicly available information about licensed exchanges will increase opportunities for scammers. OSL, for example, has been targeted by scammers who contact victims pretending to be members of its management — in effect, using the company’s reputation against it.
“It’s very hard to tell people not to fall victim to very, very convincing scammers,” says Tiu. “[They] will also find it easier to pick up certain names . . . and impersonate them using all . . . the tricks we usually see in a lot of the online scams, like phishing.”
Lawyers are trying to find a way to reconcile the regulator’s concerns about investor protection with the ambitions of crypto groups, to deliver a more freewheeling way of operating, says Michael Wong, partner at Dechert. He advises hedge funds and exchanges on gaining licences from the Hong Kong regulator.
It’s very hard to tell people not to fall victim to very, very convincing scammers
“They [the SFC] want to open up the industry but, at the same time, they always have concerns about investor protection,” says Wong.
The SFC says it has reminded investors of the risks involved in using virtual assets platforms and will ensure its regulatory regime “strikes the appropriate balance between investor protection and support for innovation”.
Wong and Jason Chan, a Dechert associate, have already helped crypto-only hedge fund Fore Elite Capital Management acquire a licence from the SFC, and then expand the conditions of that licence to allow it to invest in the top 100 most traded cryptocurrencies and derivatives. Previously, the company’s licence permitted nothing but long-only trading positions in the top 20 coins.
The SFC’s growing expertise in dealing with cryptocurrencies following Hong Kong’s digital assets push has also helped Dechert increase the regulator’s comfort level with a “riskier, aggressive strategy”, says Wong.
The law firm has had a number of inquiries from groups seeking to find out about the “widest scope” the SFC will license them to operate under.
“That’s how the crypto world was formed; they wanted a free world free of regulations,” Wong observes. “We are . . . striking a balance between the free world and what’s actually happening in reality.”"
Legal skills help unlock financing for sustainability ambitions,Legal services,"When John Yeap was a lawyer working in the energy sector in south-east Asia in the mid-1990s, he built a career advising governments on setting up coal-fired power plants — helping to fuel the stellar economic growth many countries in the region notched up in the years that followed.
But, since 2021, he and colleagues at law firm Pinsent Masons have been at the forefront of a plan to help those governments — in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines — wind down some of the very same plants to kick-start their transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.
“I spent much of my time involved in work connected to building power plants but the needs of a low-carbon world mean I’m now devoting my life to getting some of them out of the system,” says Yeap, a former partner and head of the firm’s Asian energy team, and now a consultant to the firm, based in Hong Kong. “It’s quite a switch.”
Coal is the single biggest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector. In south-east Asia — home to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) — the fuel has accounted for the largest share of the growth in total energy supply since 2000, according to the International Energy Agency. The IEA said in November that energy demand in south-east Asia was set to grow by around 3 per cent a year to 2030, with three-quarters of that increased demand being met by fossil fuels.
Energy analysts say facilitating a careful transition to renewables is imperative. “The conundrum that the [Asean] bloc’s leaders now face is how to secure energy supplies to develop the region’s economies, while also decarbonising them,” they noted at the World Economic Forum in January.
For Pinsent Masons, this has involved developing a financing structure for decommissioning of coal plants before the end of their useful life, while unlocking finance for renewables.
The firm was part of a consortium of advisers, including consultants at accountancy firm KPMG and engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald, that advised the Asian Development Bank on a funding vehicle known as an energy transition mechanism (ETM). Plans were agreed in November for the early retirement of coal-fired plants in south-east Asia, starting with Cirebon-1, a 660-megawatt plant in West Java, Indonesia.
Yeap and his team helped design and pilot the ETM through the creation of two funds. The first will pool funding from philanthropic and impact investors willing to provide debt more cheaply than normal market rates, to reduce the coal plants’ debt service costs — allowing the plants’ owners to repay the debt more quickly, in compensation for retiring their plants early. The second fund will bring together investors and lenders focused on renewable energy projects.
Structuring the ETM, to be implemented over several years, involved balancing various stakeholder interests. “A lot of these plants were built with robust contracts, so lenders and sponsors have pretty strong contractual frameworks in place,” Yeap explains.
“So, if the governments were to suddenly say ‘we are scrapping you’, they would end up in arbitration.”
Finding ways to satisfy various, often competing, interests is becoming an important factor in how lawyers approach environmental, social and governance (ESG) financing challenges.
One way to do this is to involve the beneficiaries of government funding in organising how social services are delivered.
Law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons (KWM) worked with a community of indigenous Australians to set up a governance structure to give local community leaders responsibility for funding that comes in from the government for various programmes — in line with the National Agreement on Closing the Gap.
A new Aboriginal-controlled body, set up in August 2022, ensures that the community of about 1,500 First Nations people living in Doomadgee, a remote town about 2,500km from Brisbane, plays a lead role in designing and implementing government services.
“We’d been listening to and led by community members for some time to help work out how services like housing, child safety, health, youth justice, could be delivered differently,” says Berkeley Cox, the KWM partner leading the project. Local leaders had felt their voices were not being heard, which fuelled mistrust between the community and the government.
We’d been listening to and led by community members for some time to help work out how services could be delivered differently
The new governance structure was designed by community members with KWM’s support. It embeds the First Nations concept of cultural governance “that has developed over 60,000 years” into a company framework, explains Cox — for example, including membership requirements linked to ancestral family clans.
Satisfying different priorities was also central to work by Gilbert + Tobin. The law firm advised Commonwealth Bank of Australia on a financial structure under which the bank has prepaid A$1.7mn ($1.1mn) for carbon credits that will be generated by an agricultural rewilding project in Western Australia.
The bank’s prepayment of Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) unlocks funds that two groups — Forever Wild, an ecological and social enterprise, and Corporate Carbon, an emissions-abatement venture — can use to buy the land more easily, under a pastoral lease, than if they had tried to obtain standard debt financing for such a purpose.
This allowed the groups to rear cattle in Western Australia using sustainable farming practices, while also rewilding other parts of the land, generating carbon credits to be repaid to the bank, says Ilona Millar, partner at Gilbert + Tobin in Sydney.
“One of the reasons why the bank was interested in this transaction was that this gives it access to a supply of ACCUs, which it will then be able to use with its institutional banking clients, or for its own ESG purposes,” she says. “For the two groups, it’s a way to achieve their conservation outcomes.”"
South Korea tightens grip on digital asset trading,Legal services,"Last year’s troubles with wemix — a digital coin issued by South Korean game developer Wemade — were a wake-up call for investors and regulators alike in a digital currency market that, though one of the world’s biggest, remains largely unregulated.
Wemade was one of the first major South Korean game companies to develop so-called “play-to-earn” video games, where gamers can accumulate cryptocurrency. Wemix tokens, used in the Mir 4 online game, quickly gained popularity among crypto investors.
But discontent rose sharply as Wemade expanded the distribution of wemix beyond the promised amount to fund the company’s business expansion.
“Violating its market disclosure was a serious matter as it could undermine the coin’s value and disrupt the market mechanism,” recalls Kim Ik-hyun, a partner at Yulchon, who is leading the South Korean law firm’s digital asset team.
Local cryptocurrency exchanges set up the Digital Asset Exchange Alliance (DAXA) to protect investors last June, after many were hit by the $40bn collapse in May of the terraUSD and luna coins developed by the disgraced South Korean crypto king Do Kwon.
As complaints against Wemix exploded, DAXA — composed of five main trading platforms Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax — decided to delist the coin in its first significant self-regulatory action, potentially setting a precedent for other exchanges in the US and Europe. But Wemade then filed an injunction against DAXA, claiming that the move was anti-competitive.
Yulchon, which represented Bithumb, won the dispute by arguing that the decision was made to protect investors, pointing to Wemade’s inaccurate disclosure about the token’s circulation amount.
“It was the first legal case in Korea against a major coin issuer sending out false information,” says Kim. “It was a watershed ruling showing that regulations for securities can apply to digital tokens as well.” Wemix was eventually reinstated by Coinone in February after Wemade took corrective action, including buying back and cancelling some tokens.
South Korea’s population has an outsized interest in crypto trading. The Korean won accounts for 13 per cent of global trading in bitcoin. But the country’s lack of control over crypto markets and the problems involving wemix have made regulators realise the pressing need for legal safeguards.
In another case that highlights concerns over the behaviour of crypto operators, Kang Jong-hyun, the de facto owner of Bithumb, has been charged with embezzlement, breach of trust and stock manipulation involving the exchange’s affiliates. Yulchon is not representing Kang and Kang’s lawyer has denied the charges in court.
Yulchon, the first major South Korean law firm to launch a digital assets team, in 2017, is helping DAXA to issue more detailed guidelines for the listing and delisting of such assets and advising the government to tighten oversight of the country’s exuberant crypto sector.
In February, the government announced its own guidance for security tokens — digital forms of stocks and bonds — in an attempt to improve confidence in the digital asset market.
However, several bills aimed at investor protection and transparent transactions of cryptocurrencies are still pending in parliament.
“Following the wemix delisting, token issuers are paying more attention to public disclosures and trying to follow DAXA guidelines,” says Kim.
“South Korea is becoming more proactive in creating the regulatory framework — but the bills should pass quickly to protect investors.”"
How to demystify the market prophets,Lex Populi,"Sales and profits forecasts from City analysts play an important role in determining share prices. These estimates are available to professional investors via specialist electronic databases offered by Bloomberg, Refinitiv and others.
As a rule, companies that perform better than expectations see their stock prices rise and companies that miss them suffer. On Wednesday Siemens, the €126bn German industrial conglomerate, lifted its sales and profits outlook for the fiscal year ending in September 2023. It now expects to make earnings per share of up to €9.90, compared with €5.47 last year. Its share price duly jumped.
But this behaviour does not always hold. It can be a bad idea to take these projections at face value. Streetwise private investors know there is an art to reading them. More to the point, the aggregate of such estimates may not be an accurate predictor of how the market as a whole is likely to do.
For a neat example of why relying on published estimates is not always a good strategy, look no further than the first quarter of 2023. A quick glance at reported numbers and you would be justified in thinking that companies performed much better than the market expected — and that share prices might pop. Not so.
First-quarter earnings beat analysts’ forecasts by 14 per cent on average, according to Deutsche Bank. Companies also sounded sanguine about the future. A Barclays analysis of conference-call transcripts noted that 70 per cent of companies see profit margins holding or even expanding.
Yet all of these positive surprises failed to give the markets much impetus. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Euro Stoxx 600 index are trading roughly where they were in February, before the brief banking sector-related wobble.
That suggests that cannier investors had already applied a healthy dose of scepticism to analyst forecasts. And, indeed, it is not hard to see why they might have done so.
In aggregate, analysts had been expecting a 12 per cent decline in first-quarter profits compared with the first quarter of last year. Yet resilient macroeconomic data has long suggested this might be overly gloomy. Energy costs throughout Europe have been retreating, with natural gas not far from two-year lows. UK GDP numbers showed a better performance than feared. Recent purchasing manager index releases for Europe have revealed a rising trend of confidence.
Top-down macro mood music provided a more useful indicator of the earnings consensus from bottom-up analysis. That points to some of the reasons why analyst estimates, while important, are imperfect.
Analysts can be late to the party, often publishing estimates only once a quarter or so. At any given time, the consensus reflects a mix of updated and older numbers. Moreover, analysts tend to focus — in detail — on near-term estimates. Medium-term outlooks — on which sensible investors should focus — can be roughly hewn.
Secondly, taking all analyst estimates in aggregate can give a misleading view of the market as a whole. Adding up all company forecasts overshoots GDP growth by some margin, suggests an analysis of the US stock market carried out by Verdad.
Nevertheless, analysts do provide a useful service, especially when looking at individual companies. Listed groups want to be well understood by the market, and guide the analyst community on how to model future trends. The best of the analysts can use this understanding to pick out stocks that will outperform, relative to the rest, according to a study by Hemang Desai and others for the Financial Analyst Journal.
But the lesson for investors is that, as a broader gauge of where markets are heading, published estimates should be taken with a shovelful of salt.

What analysts do understand well is how much a company’s assets might be worth. In Vodafone’s case, they reckon that the value of the constituent parts exceeds the telecom’s group market capitalisation by some margin. This suggests the group’s new chief executive, Margherita della Valle, will come under pressure to put them on the block.
That does not appear to be her plan. Della Valle’s latest turnround is a pragmatic response to competitive weakness. But it is unlikely to deliver anything like the group’s value on a sum of the parts basis. That helps explain why the market dialled down Vodafone’s shares by 7 per cent when the plan was revealed on Tuesday.
Vodafone operates in a horribly competitive European market and has an accompanying tendency to use its foot for target practice. It has stumbled in Spain and — in spectacular fashion — in Germany, its largest market, where it is losing broadband customers.
Revenues have been broadly flat for at least a decade. Returns lurk below or around cost of capital in four key markets. Vodafone’s free cash flow does not cover capex and shareholder returns, although disposals are bringing leverage down. The shares have fallen more than half over the past five years.
Remedies are scarce. Della Valle vows to improve Vodafone’s performance by slimming down headquarters and devolving power and accountability to operating subsidiaries. The company is cutting more than 10 per cent of its workforce. It will reinvest savings in a better customer experience, supposedly. It plans to chase higher-margin business clients, who value its brand.
This is sensible, but does not amount to a strategy to replace Vodafone’s failed push for scale advantages.
Ex-finance boss Della Valle deserves credit for putting Spanish assets on the block. She is open to other changes in the group’s structure. She should pursue this line of reasoning. Vodafone’s market capitalisation is £23bn. That is a discount of almost 30 per cent to a sum of the parts valuation from Citigroup.
Vodafone cannot afford to dally. Remaining investors, long kept on hold, need little excuse to disconnect. Pressure for a break-up will persist and intensify."
AngloGold Ashanti: move to US brings no quick valuation uplift,Lex,"South Africa’s gold rush began in the late 19th century. Another one has begun, this time in New York City. Enterprises outside America now seek out the deep veins of capital via the New York Stock Exchange. AngloGold Ashanti on Friday announced plans to move its primary listing to New York from Johannesburg. As with some British companies leaving their home market, it sees the potential for higher valuation over time.
A London listing was a possibility. As its name implies, AngloGold has long ties to the UK via its holding company subsidiary. Indeed, the holding company will redomicile in the UK. Moving that to the US would incur the threat of a dividend withholding tax. The South African miner has also snubbed London because two-thirds of its share trading already occurs in the US via a depository receipt.
But achieving a higher earnings multiple would not happen right away. A year ago, AngloGold and its local peer Goldfields traded just over five times their forward ebitda, 40 per cent below that of North America’s largest miners Barrick and Newmont. But since then those four multiples have converged around seven times.
A recent bull run in the gold price favours AngloGold and Goldfields. Both have the highest share three-year price sensitivity to the commodity among 17 large gold miners reviewed by Raj Ray at BMO Capital Markets. AngloGold argues that the discount would return once gold prices moderate.
Index inclusion matters too. AngloGold is a large part of the popular US Van Eyck Gold ETF. How much more passive inflows it would receive is not clear. Had it chosen London its near £9bn market value would have meant FTSE 100 inclusion, along with miners Fresnillo and Endeavour Mining. Finally there is the cost, estimated at 5 per cent of market capitalisation — some $560mn today.
That could have bought a new greenfield gold mine project, thinks BMO. Something for shareholders to ponder — three-quarters must approve — when they vote on its restructuring.

FTX/comebacks: former crypto darling needs better reboot plan,Lex,"Prices for FTX tokens, known as FTTs, got an unexpected jolt earlier this month. Six months after FTX collapsed, the crypto exchange platform’s lawyers suggested that it could stage a comeback. But the odds of a revival for a failed company operating with an unchanged business model and a notorious name are narrow.
Slim-chance comebacks happen sometimes. Think of the revival of Apple under Steve Jobs, IBM’s recovery following heavy losses in the early 1990s and carmaker GM’s post-bailout fortunes. For tarnished companies such as FTX, MoviePass, WeWork or SVB Capital these case studies offer a glimmer of hope.
More than $7bn has been recovered in cash, tokens and other assets at FTX. Creditors could, in theory, choose to restart the business.
But chief executive John Ray, hired to guide it through bankruptcy, has spent months highlighting its failures and those of founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces a number of criminal charges. Confidence in crypto has evaporated. It remains hard to insure against failures in the sector. Demand for FTX services would be low.
MoviePass also lacks the goodwill necessary to turn its fortunes round. It has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a new cinema subscription idea. But the spectacular failure of its first plan means it is unlikely to sign the sort of attractive deals with cinema chains needed to generate profits.
Office rental start-up WeWork managed to go public via a special purpose acquisition company following its failed initial public offering and the dramatic exit of its founder. Yet even after occupancy levels improved, its business continues to burn money. Cash and cash equivalents fell from about $1bn to less than $300mn last year.
SVB Capital, the venture capital arm of Silicon Valley Bank is up for sale, and might do better. Though it reported a pre-tax loss of $180mn last year, it owns stakes in some of tech’s best-known venture capital firms.
For FTX, hope and case studies would not be enough. It needs a reworked business plan and rebranding. Even a brazen reboot cannot succeed under FTX’s tarnished name.

GAM/Liontrust: lowball offer exploits fund manager’s dire record,Lex,"GAM once stood for Global Asset Management. The name was appropriate when the company was one of the largest in Europe. Today, the Swiss group is worth about SFr100mn ($112mn). That is with a bid on the table.
A name change could signal diminished status, or a reboot as an independent business. Investors led by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel would prefer that to a takeover by UK fund manager Liontrust. Niel’s grouping is promising to increase its stake above 10 per cent.
Subscale active fund managers are joining forces under pressure from index funds. Bulking up on the cheap makes sense for Liontrust. Paying with shares even more so.
The deal certainly appears to favour the bidder; Liontrust is offering a 12 per cent stake in the combined group but contributing just two-fifths of total assets. Liontrust’s offer is equal to about 0.4 per cent of GAM’s assets under management. That is about a third of Liontrust’s own valuation and even lower compared with the sector multiple.
GAM has drifted chaotically since scandalous involvement in the 2018 Greensill debacle. Operating losses widened to SFr42mn last year. Fund management assets of SFr23bn are down from SFr84bn in 2017. The board is poorly placed to demand better terms. This is why a fifth of GAM shareholders have already signed up. Fees show signs of stabilisation,
The bidder is unlikely to offer much more. Liontrust has arranged a loan to help complete the transaction, if it goes through. Cost-cutting assumptions are stretched. Liontrust hopes to achieve £57mn of recurring savings by spending £45mn. Typically, these would cost between £57mn and £86mn in asset management, noted David McCann at Numis. Job cuts in countries with strict employment laws make the job tougher. Targeted operating margins of 30 per cent will be tough to meet.
Asset management franchises are valuable for their ability to garner assets and talent. GAM lost both years ago. Unless a rival offer materialises, a Liontrust takeover is the least worst option.

Japan stocks: investors must banish spectre of bubble burst,Lex,"In the US, the average bear market historically lasts about 14 months. Stocks return to previous highs three to five years later. In contrast, Japan has waited three decades for its key stock index to revisit its record high of December 1989.
On Monday, the benchmark Topix index surpassed 2,110 points, nearing its highest level back then. Fundamentals support further advances. But Japanese investors have painful memories of the 1989 market peak: the bursting of the “bubble economy” followed. It will take nerve as well as conviction to go higher.
Some gains may be temporary. Investor sentiment rallied as the dollar strengthened last week. A weaker yen has long been taken as a signal to buy shares in exporters. The value of profits made overseas receives a boost when booked at home.
Other gains will be longer-lasting. Pressure to lift corporate returns is bearing fruit. A long list of local companies have announced large share repurchases, including technology groups Hitachi and Fujitsu.&nbsp;Activism is increasingly common. One example is ValueAct Capital’s push for change at convenience store operator Seven &amp; i Holdings. A break-up is one possible outcome.
Low valuations are supporting share price rises. The Nikkei 225 is up 15 per cent this year but still trades below its 10-year average on a forward earnings basis.&nbsp;
Retail investors may yet prove to be the main hurdle to the recovery of the local market. They remain haunted by the memories of the bursting of the asset price bubble in the 1990s. This disillusioned many Japanese proud of their country’s export success and the wealth it had created. Fortunes evaporated overnight.
“Lost decades” of stagnant growth followed. Rallies have been shortlived during bull runs, leading to years of rangebound trading.
In 2013, for example, local investors dumped almost $70bn of stocks when indices showed signs of breaking out of their trading ranges. This was despite strong earnings. For the rally to continue this time around, Japan needs to remember that today’s multiples are modest compared with the crazy levels of 1989.

Oneok/Magellan: pipe dream requires brave assumptions to become reality,Lex,"US pipeline companies are the bass players in oil industry rock bands: steady plodders for the most part rather than starry shredders such as ExxonMobil and Chevron. Now scarcity has thrown a spotlight on their value, intensified by Oneok’s recommended offer for Magellan Midstream Partners at an enterprise value of $18.8bn.
Regulatory barriers and legal challenges to new pipelines make existing ones attractive acquisition targets. By purchasing Magellan for cash and stock, Oneok would become one of the largest oil and natural gas pipeline operators in the US.
The success of the deal hinges on bullish assumptions and tax benefits. Oneok’s offer — made up of about $8.8bn in equity and $5bn in cash — represents a 25 per cent premium over Magellan’s three-month average unit price. “Synergies”, which are not clearly broken down into savings and marketing benefits, could be as much as $400mn a year, Oneok says. That would be worth about $3.2bn taxed and capitalised, covering the premium that Oneok is paying.
There is little obvious overlap from which to cut costs. Oneok transports natural gas and its byproducts. Magellan moves crude oil and its derivatives. Oneok cannot use Magellan’s oil pipelines to tap new markets for its natural gas and vice versa.
This suggests efficiencies would mostly come from office and staff overheads. The two companies had about $800mn in combined general and administrative costs. Even if you cut that down by 25 per cent, it would only yield $200mn of cost savings.
However, Oneok will get a valuable tax benefit from the transaction, which it values at about $3bn.
Like Oneok, Magellan’s business is largely fee-based. Pipeline usage fees are based on volume and tend to be locked in fixed contracts. This insulates operators from volatile hydrocarbon prices, reducing their risks.
Combined net debts would be about four times trailing ebitda, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ data. That is hardly excessive. But an 8 per cent drop in Oneok’s share price on Monday points to justifiable nerves among shareholders.

Tech start-ups: valuations are even lower than data suggests,Lex,"The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index may be up a fifth this year but the private sector is still getting mauled. Year on year median valuations of late-stage start-ups fell 17 per cent in the first quarter, according to PitchBook data. There is no reason to expect a recovery this year.
Unless it involves buzzy artificial intelligence, investor appetite for risk has waned since late 2021. A barely breathing initial public offering market means no quick exits. Higher interest rates mean pension funds and asset managers who jumped into start-ups when rates were low can find easier gains elsewhere.
Fundraising has plummeted. Last week, Japan’s SoftBank reported that its vast, tech-focused Vision Funds (which invest in public and private companies) invested just over $3bn in the fiscal year ending March 31, down from more than $44bn the previous year.
This means the true scale of value destruction remains obscured. Start-ups able to conserve money are avoiding raising capital, rightly worried that funding will mean lower valuations. Down rounds accounted for close to 20 per cent of all funding rounds in the first quarter of the year, according to data from local fintech company Carta. The previous year they made up just 5 per cent of the total.
This figure is likely to rocket. More than 90 per cent of VC-backed start-ups are not profitable and burn through cash, living on money raised when valuations were high. They cannot hang on forever. Carta logged 906 VC investments in the first quarter, down more than a third on the previous quarter. As more companies are forced to fundraise, valuations will drop.
The largest private companies offer some indication of what might happen next. Payments company Stripe’s valuation has dropped from $95bn to $50bn since 2021. Food delivery company Instacart lowered its fair market valuation from $39bn to $10bn last year. Forced to raise funds or make equity offers to employees, they have accepted sharp downgrades. As cash runways grow shorter, other start-ups will do the same. The rest of 2023 will come with a choice: cut more costs, try to raise debt or accept that the days of record valuations are over.

US bankruptcies: easy capital is a drug that induces myopia,Lex,"Kick a can down a road for long enough and fatigue ends the game. On Monday, several prominent, distressed US companies finally succumbed to bankruptcy. They included Vice Media and Envision Healthcare, whose backers included some of the world’s best-known investors.&nbsp;
The court filings are instructive. Documents not only detailed how these companies kept running out of money. They also showed that bad business models were no bar to raising more money that would itself be lost.
Just a year ago, Envision took in more than $1bn in fresh cash. Since 2020, Vice garnered at least $200mn, despite zombie-like characteristics.
Wishful thinking surrounding those deals was predicated upon low interest rates, rising valuations and miracle turnrounds in profitability that never materialised.&nbsp;
The chunks of capital will mostly be incinerated. Only senior secured lenders will receive some recoveries, predominantly in risky equity with some cash thrown in.
The curse of raising money from investors is that you then need to spend it. In go-go eras, it proves difficult to avoid going with the flow. In the instance of Vice and Envision, new money investments made as the businesses faltered typically had some seniority in the capital structure and received higher interest rates. Such terms are a double-edged sword that can inflict serious damage on a troubled enterprise.&nbsp;
Senior lender Fortress Investment Group is set to acquire Vice. The deal values the company at under $300mn. Almost a decade ago, when Vice was seen as a hot, disruptive magazine publisher, it raised equity at a valuation close to $5bn.
Envision, which comprises physician practices and surgical centres, will not take such a sharp haircut. It is perhaps worth half the value of its $10bn 2018 buyout.
Investors can learn from this. Cash calls too often forestall hard operational choices, when the latter could preserve more value in the long run. Easy capital is a powerful drug. Its side effects include myopia."
Libor to take firm step towards oblivion on New Year’s Day,Libor scandal,"On New Year’s Day a piece of financial history will be made: the tainted Libor benchmark will take a decisive step towards being phased out after 45 years as a fixture of global markets.
From January, the lending rate cannot be used as the reference rate in any new derivatives contracts, loans and credit card offers.
It will continue to live, in a lesser form, for the $230tn of existing contracts that rely on it as the basis for interest payments. But for regulators and banks, next month represents the moment when four years of arduous preparation to live without it goes into effect.
“It’s one of the biggest transitions in financial markets in decades,” said Dixit Joshi, group treasurer of Deutsche Bank. “This is a milestone for the regulators since the great financial crisis about lessons learned.”
Libor limped along after it was blighted by scandal when traders at the world’s big investment banks were caught trying to rig the rate in their favour, and were hit with $10bn of fines as punishment. But even as it tried to reform the tainted lending rate its chief regulator, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, fretted over an even more substantial issue: a number announced every day at about 11.55am in London posed a serious risk to the stability of the financial system.
While the rate acted as a reference price for contracts that affected millions of consumers, the bank funding activity it was supposed to reflect no longer existed. The daily submissions from banks for the daily fixing were largely estimates. Moreover, after the bruising scandals, the banks no longer wanted the job.
By 2017, the FCA and other regulators arrived at a more radical solution: switch off the 35 different rates, spread across five currencies, from the start of 2022. Thousands of contracts would lose the rate that forms the basis of their value.
There was no like-for-like substitute for Libor, which reflected investors’ expectations of future rates. It also included a component for banks’ credit risk. Users, such as corporations and asset managers, liked it because they would know in advance the size of their interest rate payments.
Authorities wanted the replacement to be based on overnight lending rates, which were based on transactions that took place the day before. That stripped out the bank credit risk component, making them “risk free”. They were more attuned to domestic interest rates but reflected deals done, not the future. Not all countries had a ready-made alternative. The UK could turn to Sonia, a well-used overnight lending rate; the US had to create a new rate, Sofr, from scratch.For banks and regulators, it meant not only developing new benchmarks but drawing up alternative legal safeguards, and constantly pounding the drum that the market needed to be ready. The pandemic-induced market volatility last year, when global interest rates were cut, has only strengthened regulators’ resolve.
“As we saw in March and April 2020, [Libor rates] were going up in times of economic stress,” said Edwin Schooling Latter, who is leading the push to switch at the FCA. “One could argue the banks were passing on to their customers the bank’s own cost of funding . . . Our view is that the banks are better placed to manage that risk than retail customers.”
The transition has sometimes resembled an energy-sapping marathon. Many felt it was impossible not only to create risk-free rates but also build up trading in futures markets, which would supply investors’ expectations of future rates. “If you’d asked anyone at the end of 2017 if this was going to happen by the end of 2021, they’d have laughed at you,” said Sarah Boyce of the UK’s Association of Corporate Treasurers.
That scepticism has been partially vindicated. Even as the year began, contracts worth $265tn were still attached to Libor. Embedding an alternative for US dollar Libor has been particularly tricky because it was a new rate.
To ease the burden, UK and US authorities have allowed US dollar Libor for existing contracts to continue until mid-2023, although new business is barred after December. The FCA also allowed “synthetic” versions of sterling and yen Libor for a year to wean more stubborn contracts off the rate. Even so, daily publication of 24 Libor rates will go after December.
Those who have not switched their contracts will be relying on the temporary versions of Libor, which will be based on a set formula, and their fallbacks, which track the difference between the new risk-free rates and Libor.
Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has estimated that 68 out of the 262 non-US dollar Libor structured finance transactions it had originally rated will rely on “synthetic” Libor rates.
In the final months, the marathon has turned into a dash. The majority of volumes of new privately negotiated swaps deals in the UK pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Singapore dollar, now largely uses the new so-called risk-free rates.
Clearing houses switched large batches of open contracts in the weekends leading up to Christmas. London’s LCH converted 285,000 sterling, Swiss franc, euro and yen swaps, with a notional value of $20tn, from Libor into their risk-free equivalents. ICE Clear Europe converted 3.5m contracts. Consequently, many expect the switchover in rates such as sterling and the Swiss franc to produce few fireworks in the first days of trading. The Sonia benchmark is about 0.2 per cent, similar to the three-month dollar Libor rate.
That leaves authorities focused on the stubbornly slower take-up of US dollar Libor, representing about $230tn of deals. The overnight Sofr rate is 0.05 per cent, compared with three-month dollar Libor of about 0.2 per cent. Roughly 70 per cent of new swaps still referenced Libor in November, according to data from Osttra. US regulators’ efforts over the summer to move futures on to Sofr have had only limited success.
“Telling people to stop using Libor is like reimposing prohibition. People will keep drinking right up until the last moment,” said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America.
Regulators warn that these may be the last concessions. “Market participants have all the tools they need to meet this deadline. The responsibility is on market participants to take the action needed to prepare for a world with no new Libor,” said Tom Wipf, a senior executive at Morgan Stanley, who chairs the industry body to lead the shift from US dollar Libor.
The FCA has not decided whether it will continue with synthetic versions of US dollar Libor after June 2023, and will make a decision towards the end of next year. Schooling Latter warned that synthetic versions would not last for ever. “People should not assume there will be a synthetic version of US dollar Libor,” he said.
Even so, the market accepts change is coming. At CME Group, the world’s largest futures market, open positions in Sofr-linked futures outstripped Libor-linked futures for the first time in December.
“This transition has been like&nbsp;open-heart surgery on the financial system. Now we need to use the tools, knowledge and partnerships we have built to get to the next&nbsp;level,” said Tal Reback, who leads the global Libor transition effort at&nbsp;KKR. “It’s no small feat.”"
UK watchdog orders publication of ‘synthetic’ dollar Libor rate,Libor transition,"The UK financial watchdog has ordered that some Libor rates continue to be published beyond the original June deadline, giving market participants more time to shift away from the tainted lending benchmark.
The Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday that synthetic versions of the one, three and six-month US dollar Libor rates would continue to be published “for a short period” after the original June 30 cut-off point — before ending for good in September 2024. Synthetic Libor attempts to mimic what Libor would have been, if it had continued to exist.
The regulator’s decision, which follows a consultation last November to gauge views on a synthetic rate, is the latest sign of how extensive and complicated the transition process has proved. A large proportion of the $1.4tn US “junk” loan market had not yet switched to Libor’s replacement, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, with just months to go at the start of this year.
US dollar Libor was used for decades to price various debt and derivative products around the world and became key to multiple manipulation and price rigging scandals since the global financial crisis, with several traders facing criminal charges.
The US leveraged loan market — which typically refers to low-grade loans with floating interest rates, issued by companies with large debt piles — has been a battleground for the transition away from the Libor benchmark because of disagreement over the appropriate terms of switching.
The biggest buyers of US leveraged loans are vehicles called collateralised loan obligations (CLO), which own roughly two-thirds of the market. Some CLO investors have pushed for an additional “credit spread adjustment” to account for the lack of risk premium factored in to the new Sofr rate, owing to differences in the way the two benchmarks are constructed.
The FCA said “a small but material subset of contracts” would not be able to transition away from US dollar Libor by the previously announced end date of June 30, and that a temporary extension “may help market participants to transition . . . and thus avoid a disorderly cessation.”
“Synthetic Libor is only a temporary bridge,” the FCA said, adding that it “will not continue simply for the convenience of those who could have transitioned their contracts but have not done so.”
All “legacy contracts except cleared derivatives” can continue to use the three agreed Libor rates, the regulator said.
The FCA said on Monday that the extra 15 months of synthetic Libor publication gives users plenty of time to shift to an alternative rate and that any outstanding exposures beyond September 2024 “may be due to parties to contracts having made a conscious choice not to transition, or having failed to take steps to transition in a timely manner.”
The FCA has already extended publication of some synthetic sterling Libor rates beyond the December 2022 deadline."
LSE Group joins battle between exchanges for crypto derivatives,London Stock Exchange Group,"The London Stock Exchange Group plans to begin clearing crypto derivatives, joining the battle among the world’s big exchanges to grab a slice of rising institutional demand to trade digital assets.
The UK group will use the Paris arm of its clearing subsidiary, LCH, to manage the risks on bitcoin futures and options traded on GFO-X, a UK regulated marketplace, the company said on Thursday.
Its move comes in spite of waves of bankruptcies among crypto companies, sharp declines in the prices of tokens and a series of enforcement actions by US regulators. In the past three months the price of bitcoin has climbed more than 50 per cent, outstripping the performance of many other markets.
The move is also a coup for France, which has set itself up as one of the most open crypto havens in the G7 and sought to lure big companies into setting up offices and regional headquarters in Paris.
Asset managers and traders have turned to crypto derivatives as many of them cannot trade coins due to regulatory and compliance concerns.
Many of the LSE’s biggest rivals, such a CME Group, CBOE Global Markets and Deutsche Boerse have all stepped up offerings to customers that wrap crypto assets in more traditional products and services.
Frank Soussan, head of LCH DigitalAssetClear, the new LCH unit for clearing digital assets, said there was a lot of demand from institutional investors to trade
For it to happen “there needs to be a framework which they are familiar with and comfortable with which at this stage is traditional market infrastructure, a regulated market venue and regulated [clearing house]”.
Derivatives such as futures and options products allow traders to bet that the price of an asset will rise or fall in a certain timeframe while only funding a fraction of the value of their trades.
Investors can leverage their positions and boost the size of profits but adverse market moves can also lead to outsized losses.
Founded in 2020, GFO-X is run by a group of former hedge fund managers and clearing and settlement executives. Arnab Sen, its co-founder, said he “set the company up specifically to provide institutional access to the digital asset space.”
Sen, who previously founded hedge fund Harbour Capital, said that institutions could not really get into the market unless they were reassured that their counterparty would not default.
“In traditional markets, that risk is solved for via a [central counterparty clearing house],” he added. A clearing house sits between two parties in a transaction, helping manage adverse fallout if one side defaults.
LCH is the world’s largest derivatives clearing house but the business is largely housed at its London arm. LCH’s Paris arm will settle the derivatives with cash and the margin for its crypto unit will be held separately.
“DigitalAssetClear will have its own default fund and its own set of rules in order to prevent any contagion effect,” added Soussan. “At no point in time [will LCH SA hold] the physical bitcoin asset which removes a large component of the risk,” he said.
To calculate its margin levels, LCH SA will use a reference rate built by GFO-X and crypto data firm Coin Metrics that draws prices from seven exchanges, Soussan added.
LCH’s Paris arm aims to begin clearing crypto derivatives in the fourth quarter of the year, subject to regulatory approvals."
Man Group: Grew must help hedgie grow,Man Group PLC,"Continuity is a big deal in the UK. Monarchy aside, Britain boasts a hedge fund business with a 240-year history. Robyn Grew is the latest boss to take charge at Man Group, once a rum supplier to the British Navy.
Grew is currently president of the world’s largest listed hedge fund manager. She will replace Luke Ellis as chief executive when he retires in September.
He has steadied the ship since he took the helm in 2016. He has also pushed heavily into AI-driven investment techniques, a natural move for a quant-based business.
Grew is therefore taking over at a critical moment. A couple of years ago, techniques such as natural language processing were an esoteric way for hedge funds to seek a competitive edge. Now Silicon Valley giants are investing billions in AI, they are becoming more widely available.
Grew needs to ensure that Man, best known for its momentum-driven AHL strategies, stays relevant.
Under Ellis’s tenure, assets under management have grown from $81bn to about $145bn. He has cemented Man’s business model as a manager that serves institutional investors. That means lower margins. But these clients are less fickle than hedge funds’ traditional wealthy retail clients.
Man acquired rival GLG for $1.6bn in 2010. The deal aimed to diversify profits by adding discretionary hedge fund strategies. The integration was rocky. A $1bn writedown ensued.
Man’s valuation has been hampered by heavy reliance on performance fees. These have averaged 20 per cent of revenues over ten years, estimates Citi. But the variation can be wide, ranging from 5-30 per cent per year.
That helps explain Man Group’s cheaper valuation compared to some UK fund managers. It trades at nearly eleven times forward earnings versus 17.8 times for Abrdn and 14 times for Schroders.
In theory, its focused offer should make it more valuable than struggling generalist Abrdn. Grew needs to project that to shareholders — and ensure the democratisation of AI and other big data techniques do not turn Man into a generalist too.

Robyn Grew: the ‘force of nature’ named Man Group chief executive,Man Group PLC,"When Robyn Grew was working for Lehman Brothers in London in 1999, Japanese regulators raided the bank as part of an investigation into accusations that it and others had helped financial institutions conceal losses.
Grew was quickly dispatched to Tokyo by Lehman’s top brass to help deal with the bank’s response. She spent the next year flying back and forth between the two capital cities, eventually moving there with her wife for a stint.
The episode reflects several traits that close associates say define Grew: a quick thinker and a natural problem solver whose curiosity drives an eagerness to learn on her feet.
This week the gregarious former barrister was named incoming chief executive of Man, the world’s largest listed hedge fund manager with $144.7bn in assets under management.
By the end of this year — and for the first time since it began life in the sugar industry in the late 18th century — Man will be led by two women.
Grew will replace longstanding chief Luke Ellis in September, and former Capital International executive Anne Wade is taking over from investment banker John Cryan as chair.
For 54-year-old Grew, who at present is the president of Man, the promotion marks the culmination of a 14-year career at the FTSE 250 group that she joined in 2009 as its chief compliance officer. Since then she has held a variety of positions including global head of legal and compliance, chief operating officer, general counsel, group COO and head of environmental social and governance.
“I’ve seen her in various avatars . . . she’s quite a force of nature,” said Dev Sanyal, chief executive of Varo Energy and a former non-executive director at Man. “She has a strong compass about who she is and what she does.”
Born in London to an NHS doctor father and a school teacher mother, Grew attended grammar school in Essex and had little idea that the world of financial services even existed.
She studied business law at Coventry University before qualifying as a criminal barrister and then being tempted into the more lucrative world of finance.
Responding to a newspaper advertisement, she joined Fidelity in 1994, followed by a move to the trading floor — the then London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange — during its heyday as an open outcry exchange.
She followed LIFFE with senior positions at Lehman and Barclays Capital. Then a call from the top executives of hedge fund GLG Partners — spun out of Lehman and who she knew from her days there — piqued her curiosity. She joined GLG and the hedge fund industry in 2009, and the following year Man bought GLG for $1.6bn.
Man today is a very different business to the one Grew first knew. The deal was regarded as a reverse takeover by GLG and its aftermath was marked by a testing period of client withdrawals, poor performance at Man’s flagship quantitative strategy unit, AHL, and a culture clash between GLG’s swashbuckling star traders and Man’s PhD quants. The GLG acquisition was later written down by more than $1bn.
Then Manny Roman was appointed Man chief executive in 2013, followed by Ellis in 2016, kicking off a reboot of the company. Behind the scenes, Grew played a central role in the group’s turnround and recovery, working with Roman, Ellis and the then chief financial officer Jonathan Sorrell. She was “the definition of cool, calm and collected” in navigating the egos involved, said one person there at the time.
“There were some quite difficult things we had to do in reorienting the business,” recalled Sorrell, now president of Capstone Investment Advisors. “Robyn was someone you could always count on to do the right thing and move things forward.”
Kate Barker, a former non-executive at Man, said: “She’s really good at pulling out the meat of an issue and distinguishing between big strategic issues and the detail.”
According to those who have worked with her, Grew is an empathetic colleague and a vocal champion of difference — not diversity in the box-ticking sense, but diversity of thought, talent and approach.
While she has on occasion encountered sexism and homophobia in her own career, Grew has met this with customary candour, believing that “turning up and being me and living who I am and talking about my wife and son is incredibly persuasive”, as she has told friends.
Grew inherits a business in good shape that has evolved from a siloed organisation to a large technology-driven investment group. Today 60 per cent of its assets come from its lower-margin solutions business, offering bespoke and tailored partnerships with clients.
But she still faces challenges, beyond the regime change of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
Man has set out its stall on being an active investment group, an approach that faces continuous pressure from cheaper passive investing. It must expand in the US and stay relevant to investors in a world where the hedge fund industry is becoming more and more concentrated. And it must navigate an increasingly complex and politicised environment for ESG investing.
For Grew personally, she must put her own mark on the group after two high-profile chief executives. “Manny and Luke have been at the forefront of the industry,” said Sanyal. “What does Man Group under Robyn look like?”"
Harness the power of AI to tackle financial crime,Markets Insight,"The writer is chair and chief executive of Nasdaq
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are rightly seen as a step-change in our technology economy. For the world of finance, much of the reaction has been focused on the risks from this rapid shift.
Concerns have rightly been raised about the capacity of regulators to oversee AI operations, market concentration risks from the small number of service providers, and digital herding where computers all act alike, reinforcing market swings.
While calls for caution and proactive regulation are appropriate, so are the calls for urgency and optimism as we empower industries to start harnessing the potential of the AI advances.
This starts with recognising that all AI is not created equal. Yes, the power of generative AI, which allows images and text to be created from prompts, has captured the world’s imagination. But AI has been deployed across our markets for many years.&nbsp;
Nasdaq uses AI for predictive market maintenance — preventing disruptions before they occur — and we are embedding AI in different stages across our operations. It is particularly important for our anti-financial crime software division. Within the world of finance, AI’s capacity to help detect, deter and stop financial crime is perhaps the most compelling use case of the technology.
Financial crime is a major — and thriving — global industry. Estimates from LexisNexis show banks spend nearly $275bn on tackling financial crime annually. Yet UN studies suggest less than 1 per cent of the approximately $4tn of illicit funds that are in circulation across the financial system is currently being intercepted by law enforcement.&nbsp;
One contributor to this disconnect is the restrictive impact of regulations that limit the banks’ use of data and advanced technology.
To put it most simply, financial crime is a data problem. Criminals don’t bank with only one bank. They exploit the entire financial ecosystem to avoid detection. The increasing interconnectivity of the financial system and the emergence of new payments systems are all helping criminals become more effective.
Therefore, on the crime-fighting side, the quality and depth of our data sets, combined with the use of the latest analytics technologies, are the most critical determinants of success in stopping crime.
In Nasdaq’s anti-financial crime division, we have built data lakes that bring together normalised and anonymised transaction data from more than 2,400 banks. This consortium data approach, combined with advanced AI algorithms, has boosted our ability to detect suspicious transaction patterns.
Yet, banks are expected to provide end-to-end explainability to any model that they use, including for crime fighting, which greatly inhibits the impact.
After years of fighting market manipulation and financial crime, two truths stand out: criminals don’t follow laws or regulations and they leverage technological innovation at scale and speed to stay multiple steps ahead of detection. It is, therefore, critical that we find common ground with regulators around solutions to tackle this insidious problem.
That starts with responsible data sharing. In the US, banks are allowed to share information for the purpose of fighting crime. Enabling financial institutions in Europe, Canada and other regions to share data both from within and outside their own networks would greatly enhance our ability to identify criminal activity. There are proven models that enable data sharing while protecting individuals’ rights to privacy. These can — and should — be replicated at scale.
The second imperative is for regulators to allow the industry to leverage the latest capabilities in cloud, AI and machine learning so we can better respond to new threats, increase effectiveness and improve efficiency.
And finally, there is an opportunity to increase collaboration. Criminal enterprises are deeply connected and the financial system needs to mirror that by strengthening collaboration between the private sector, government and law enforcement. One critical change would be the deployment of “feedback loops”: communication from law enforcement to banks to confirm whether reported activity was found to be criminal or not. This requires little investment but allows banks to refine their algorithms based on real-world outcomes.
The fight against financial crime is complex enough as it is.&nbsp;I strongly urge regulators to reduce, not add to, the complexity.&nbsp;Let’s leverage the next wave of innovation to strengthen the integrity of the financial system, with technology on our side."
How fintech can adapt to a tougher environment,Markets Insight,"The writer is chief executive of Fidelity International
It would be easy to sympathise with Henry Kissinger when he joked: “There can’t be a crisis next week, my schedule is already full.” Stresses in the banking sector and the “shotgun weddings” of lenders such as First Republic have added a layer of volatility to an already challenging economic and financial outlook.
For some, it might revive bad memories of the turbulence of 2008. But the years after the financial crisis saw a positive burst of creativity in the fintech sector, and the application of a start-up ethos to financial problems. It was spurred on by changing consumer behaviour, advances in technology and connectivity and by ultra-low interest rates.
Any change of environment brings a change of mood and the current one is no different. The rapid tightening of financial conditions after years of relative stability and cheap funding is leading to a sense of concern in the fintech industry.
While economic cycles may come and go, this one has the potential to be particularly challenging for those firms that rely on funding from private investors, who are themselves under greater pressure to produce returns as exit opportunities and valuations wane.
Private company financing in the fintech sector dropped by about two-thirds year on year in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Financial Technology Partners. That figure ticked up in the first quarter of this year, but a big chunk of that was due to Stripe’s $6.5bn funding round at a $50bn valuation, 47 per cent below its high set in 2021. The actual number of financing rounds also picked to 794 deals in the first quarter from 681 deals in the last three months of 2022, according to the FTP data. But that still remained below the heightened levels reached in 2021 and early 2022.
Fintech firms now operate in a more competitive environment than before, and the fight for both cost-conscious clients and increasingly wary investors will intensify. That will force many firms to focus on survival in the immediate future, and a faster path to profitability, rather than growth at any price.
The sudden change in market environment might, for some founders, feel like sailing into a storm in shark-infested waters. To maximise the chances of survival, they need three things: a well-drilled crew in a seaworthy boat, enough life jackets for everyone on board and, just in case all that fails, the ability to swim fast to the shore. Or, in other words: risk mitigation, contingency planning and agility. Having all three will greatly improve the chances of making it to calmer waters.
Mitigation strategies can come in the form of diversified products or services, as well as carefully managed finances. Contingency, meanwhile, takes a fair bit of imagination. It involves monitoring and prioritising potential existential risks and developing response plans that can be activated at short notice when needed.
Of all these factors, however, it is agility — or the capacity to change tack and seize on new business models, product offerings and funding opportunities — that will make the difference for fintech firms. With high competition for diminishing sources of revenue and investment, and the difficulty of diversifying both at a small company, the incentive to make quick strategic changes increases.
It also helps to think about the when, how and what to communicate as part of changing a business. Managing it to make sure that there’s the right balance of urgency and reassurance, is crucial.
Long-term survival is often underrated as a business objective but without it, all other strategic aims are moot. It is especially important in a difficult and fast-moving environment where the rate of change seems to be accelerating.
While this downturn may be the first experienced by younger firms, the recent crisis in banking in the US and Europe is unlikely to be the last — and as Kissinger pointed out, a crisis never seems to occur at a convenient moment. So it is the ability of an organisation to keep showing up, day after day, no matter the external conditions, that forms the basis for any future prosperity.
For fintech firms, the speed of decision-making to improve client and funding market fit, and the ability to implement those changes quickly and effectively, may start to separate those that make it through the cycle intact, and those that don’t.
The rewards on offer will be large. The survivors in the fintech industry will find themselves in a market with fewer competitors — outswimming the other swimmers is sometimes more important than trying to outswim the shark."
The DeFi world faces a jarring transition,Markets Insight,"The writer is partner at Klaros Group
US regulators have been stepping up their scrutiny of decentralised finance, a burgeoning marketplace for crypto assets that operates without meaningful regulatory oversight.
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a revised proposal last month clarifying that DeFi crypto trading systems should be regulated like stock exchanges. And the US Treasury also issued a paper in April that pointed out the illicit finance risks in DeFi.
These moves are the latest sign that, even as regulators crack down on crypto’s centralised intermediaries in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy, they are attempting to prevent DeFi from becoming a crypto haven. Doing so will challenge the central animating principles underlying DeFi: self-reliance and the credo that “code is law”.
The failure of FTX exposed the conflicts inherent in the business model of crypto platforms. These platforms play the role of broker, exchange, market maker and custodian — all required to be independent in traditional markets. FTX allegedly used customer assets to prop up its affiliated trading firm, putting those assets at risk and, ultimately, resulting in customer losses.
In the wake of FTX, some in the crypto community pointed to DeFi as the answer. In DeFi, market participants maintain custody of their own crypto assets and transact using protocols — a set of code, standards and processes. This happens without the overt participation of centralised intermediaries. Decentralised exchanges and lending protocols have accounted for more than 10 per cent of daily crypto trading activity at times in 2023.
Regulators around the world, anticipating DeFi as the next frontier in crypto, have studied its risks, guided by the principle that risks should be regulated. The SEC points out that, despite undertaking functions commonly performed by a stock exchange, DeFi trading protocols have not even attempted to comply with securities laws.
But while complying with securities laws is necessary, it is hardly sufficient to make DeFi a trustworthy market. What would it take? At a minimum, market participants must trust they will receive the basic benefit of their bargain, and have recourse if they do not.
DeFi does not adhere to that principle — and arguably turns it on its head. DeFi purports to replace trust in institutions — intermediaries, laws, regulations — with trust in the DeFi protocols. In DeFi, in other words, “code is law”. But, as discussed in a paper by Antonio Weiss, Jonathan Everhart and myself, DeFi has no answer to the simple question: what happens if something goes wrong?
Smart contracts — the “instructions” that enable transactions to be executed on blockchains — will robotically execute the task they are programmed to carry out. However, smart contracts cannot be programmed to address all circumstances that arise in markets.
In traditional markets, participants who suffer harm can seek recourse from intermediaries, regulators and, ultimately, from any counterparty through the legal system. DeFi participants, on the other hand, are expected to accept the outcome even when they are scammed. And DeFi protocols are hacked or exploited on a seemingly daily basis. In 2022 alone, more than $3.1bn of crypto assets were stolen from DeFi protocols, representing more than 80 per cent of all thefts involving crypto assets, according to Chainanalysis.
Ultimately, “code is law” means “caveat emptor”. That doctrine, with its sense of self-reliance, resonates with many in the crypto world. But every meaningful financial market in the world provides recourse to investors who are harmed and accountability for actions that undermine market integrity.
This would require a sea change in DeFi and puncture its aesthetic of self-reliance, which seems driven by nostalgia for a (largely fictional) time before the purity of markets was disturbed by messy laws and regulations designed to bring financial market activities within societal norms.
Indeed, crypto advocates have all but ruled out the possibility of adhering to existing standards, some saying it would actually be impossible. SEC chair Gary Gensler made clear that approach will fall on deaf ears at the regulator. “Calling yourself a DeFi platform is not an excuse to defy the securities laws,” he said last month.
In the end, DeFi is unlikely to flourish if it remains outside regulatory parameters. And yet, it is not clear what remains of the concept if it is brought fully within scope. The transition will be jarring for those who believe that laws and regulations can be replaced by trustless markets where code reigns supreme.

Why investors should collaborate to tackle climate change,Markets Insight,"The writer is a portfolio manager and chair of sustainable investing at Brown Advisory
COP26 is under way, generating debates around the investor role in tackling climate change. Many are focused on ferreting out virtue-signalling imposters among asset managers on environmental, social and governance issues.
This is important, but a bit distracting at a time when our existential dependence on a stable climate must be matched with climate solutions at scale. This requires capital and the asset management industry is in a privileged position to bring that capital along.
We can start as an industry by acknowledging the urgency. Even if we stop burning fossil fuels, global warming will cause disruption that we can adjust to only if we preserve and restore our planet’s richest natural carbon sinks (tropical and old growth forests, peat lands, etc).
Government and non-profit funding does not come close to supporting the $4tn per year the International Energy Agency estimates will be needed by 2030 to keep global emissions in check. Without new financing, natural resources may become too scarce and too expensive to support many business models.
The world of investing and the lexicon of nature, conservation and competition have typically clashed. However, climate change requires us to align capital with solutions to tackle it.
Security analysis is not indifferent to nature. Consider a company’s cost of goods sold: building materials, food and beverages, semiconductors, reagents for recent vaccine innovations. Peel back a layer and we are talking the language of nature: trees, palm oil, coffee, gold, copper, biodiversity. It has been estimated that more than half of the world’s gross domestic product — $44tn of economic value — is at moderate or severe risk due to nature loss.
Take-and-deplete is the assumption of traditional financial models. Today, it is more practical for investors to understand the risks to our “natural capital”.
An emerging success story is how increased investor scrutiny of palm oil production has decoupled some supply chains from environmentally-destructive sourcing practices. The majority of suppliers and purchasers now pledge zero deforestation. According to the World Resources Institute, 2020 is the fourth straight year that palm oil deforestation has been trending down. It’s a win for investors and businesses as well. The conservation group WWF reports that many sector companies benefited significantly through price premiums for sustainable sourcing.
Companies will find it easier to compete and differentiate themselves once they collaborate on some new ground rules to refocus them on longer-term interests.
For example, under the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate, more than 200 companies participate in collaborative efforts with civil society, intergovernmental organisations and affected communities to advance water sustainability.
No company can survive without water and it’s estimated that half of the world’s population will reside in water-stressed areas by 2025. Investors should increasingly take note of the businesses sharing the burden of investing in water security and other natural resources to protect their bottom lines. These are the companies better prepared for a day when new rules, price signals, scarcity or reputational risks incentivise replenishment, rather than depletion of resources.

New collaborative financial structures have emerged that unlock climate solutions and strong risk-adjusted returns. “Blended finance”, for example, takes development finance and improves a project’s risk/return profile through co-investments, technical assistance, incentives or guarantees.
In Nigeria, for example, public money from the World Bank’s Nigeria Electrification Project plus philanthropic dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation provided support for structuring a private investment from CrossBoundary Group, a partner of Brown Advisory. This financed solar mini-grids that will provide clean electricity to 55,000 rural homes. Early results show strong internal rates of return in the mid-teens.
While blended finance projects are designed to create environmental or social impact, there’s a lot for financial investors to like as well, such as an inflation hedge and exposure to returns that are uncorrelated with public equities and bonds.
Investors can further be enticed by using our own jargon: the promise of an asymmetric upside, because most natural resources outside fossil fuels will be more valuable tomorrow than they are today. If asset managers signal a willingness to learn, participate and bring other stakeholders along, the opportunity is an asymmetric upside for us all.

"With Erdoğan ahead in Turkey’s elections, investors must reprice risks",Markets Insight,"The writer is chief investment officer of emerging market debt at FIM Partners
Debt and currency investors went into the Turkish elections pricing in a high chance of an opposition victory in the first round. Such victory was meant to bring about a return to economic orthodoxy even if it was understood that the macro challenges ahead were monumental and opposition unity was anything but guaranteed.&nbsp;
Five-year credit default swaps — a kind of insurance instrument to hedge against debt default — for Turkey had rallied, falling 70 basis points to 480bp going into the election last week. And investors had been buying the external bonds ahead of the event. Local currency bonds were pricing in large rate rises in anticipation of an opposition-controlled central bank that would be more responsive to inflationary challenges.
This is all gone now: those trades are being unwound with the CDS back up to 605bp and expectation of rate increases is reversing. Not only did the opposition not win outright, but the probability of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan winning in the second round of elections has risen considerably with the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) and its allies on track to secure a majority in the Turkish Assembly.
There will be a temptation to think that with Erdoğan more likely to retain control, markets will settle back to the status quo ante before the election.
That’s unlikely. For investors, what has kept Turkish risk in check over the past few years has partly been the combination of financial repression — or the government’s capture of domestic dollar savings and control over financial flows to keep the lira stable — and the selling of assets such as reserves.
And the expectation of a change in economic policy direction at some point down the road.
Whilst financial repression will continue under Erdoğan, the room to manoeuvre is getting narrower by the day, with each measure imposed by the government having a knock-on effect on different economic actors.&nbsp;A bank deposit scheme to provide an incentive to locals to keep their savings in lira, for example, is posing a large contingent liability to government finances when the lira depreciates against the dollar.
Likewise, the country’s and the central bank balance sheets have been run down to exceedingly low levels. Net foreign exchange reserves of the bank are running at levels insufficient to cover the large foreign exchange refinancing needs of the country.
Admittedly, economists and market participants have been pointing out the unsustainability of the Turkish economic model for years, but the damage to the balance sheet has never been as deep as it is today. In other words, initial conditions have never been as weak relative to previous crises.
The extent of internal and external imbalances is extreme, with both inflation and external deficits running at very elevated levels.&nbsp;The current account deficit was running at $54bn on a 12-month trailing basis in March, close to the all-time highs over the past decade. Meanwhile, inflation, while decelerating somewhat, is still more than 40 per cent year on year.
Political change was meant to be the conduit for a turn in economic policy direction. Absent that, this will now have to come from within the AKP itself. It is not impossible. Erdoğan could have an ideological epiphany on the economy. Or maybe, with a more comfortable majority in power, he could come to the more prosaic realisation that the only way out from the current economic predicaments is orthodoxy.
There have been market friendly appointments to key economic posts in the past but those have been shortlived or overpowered by the power of the presidency.
Turkey has had strong financial backers of late, mostly from the Gulf — Saudi Arabia, for example, deposited $5bn into the Turkish central bank in March as the country was dealing with the aftermath of a massive earthquake in February. But even Gulf creditors are becoming more credit sensitive and more attuned to the difficult economic realities globally and on the ground.
The reality is that the history of economic management under the AKP has been one of growth at all costs, no matter the imbalances, with a sharp focus on the next election.&nbsp;
What this means in practical terms is that the country will continue to walk on the edge of the precipice, if only one or two steps closer now. Markets will have to reprice accordingly, taking a dimmer view on Turkish credit, and incorporating a higher probability of a financial accident."
New Wall Street ‘fear gauge’ to track short-term market swings,Markets volatility,"The Vix — the volatility index popularly known as “Wall Street’s fear gauge” — is going through its biggest shake-up in years with the creation of a new version that will track expectations of short-term market swings.
The 1-day Volatility Index — or Vix1d — which will be launched by exchange group Cboe on Monday, is a response to a recent transformation in derivatives markets that had sparked concerns about the effectiveness and relevance of the original Vix.
It will measure expected volatility in the S&amp;P 500 over the next day of trading, rather than over the next month like the Vix.
Rob Hocking, Cboe head of product innovation, said in an interview with the Financial Times that a surge in short-term options trading “provided a certain feel to the market that the 30-day just wasn’t capturing . . . we hope the shorter-dated index will match better”.
Almost half of trading in S&amp;P 500 options so far this month has been in contracts that expire on the day they are traded. Such short-term contracts allow traders to take more targeted positions around events such as economic data releases or monetary policy meetings, but the activity is not included in the calculation of the main Vix.
Short-term trading volumes have almost quadrupled since the start of 2020, thanks in part to the addition of new contracts that allowed investors to make zero-day trades every day of the week.
Hocking said the original Vix was “still measuring exactly what it’s designed to measure”, but said “people were looking to it to give insight into moves that it was never designed to capture . . . [so] it made sense to add to the Vix complex”.
The Vix, which launched 30 years ago this month, helped to revolutionise US markets by distilling the prices of thousands of different options contracts into a single number that became shorthand for investor expectations of market volatility.
An average of about 750,000 Vix futures and options contracts a day were traded in 2022, and the index is closely followed by bankers as a signal for timing fundraising deals such as initial public offerings.
However, many observers have been surprised by how calm the index has been throughout the stock market downturn that began last year. Some investment funds that relied on a rising Vix to hedge against stock declines performed even worse than the wider S&amp;P 500 in 2022. One senior IPO banker who used to use the index as a trigger for deal roadshows said “the Vix doesn’t work as an indicator right now”.
Options specialists said the indicator was not broken but had become so ubiquitous that it was often misused or oversimplified.
“It can often be misunderstood,” said Edward Monrad, head of market structure at Optiver, the Netherlands-based market maker. “It is in a sense a fairly narrow product, it’s . . . not a measure of what has happened or directionality in the [stock] index, which people assume it might be.”
The Vix tends to rise when stocks fall, but it can also jump if investors expect a sharp improvement in conditions. Conversely, if stocks fall slowly and steadily — like last year — the Vix may remain fairly low.
“The fear gauge moniker doesn’t help,” said Roni Israelov, chief investment officer at NDVR and a former manager of options strategies at AQR. “People were surprised by the performance of Vix futures-based strategies last year . . . [but] most of the year it was a slow grind down [in stock prices]. Given the underlying volatility of equities, it’s not clear that the Vix misbehaved.”
The Vix1d’s short-term focus is expected to make it much more volatile than the 30-day original. In the days following Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse last month, the Vix jumped from 19 to 26.5 — above its long-term average, but nowhere near the levels normally associated with panic. The Vix1d, in contrast, would have leapt from 15.3 to 40.2.
For now, the exchange has no plans to offer contracts tied directly to the one-day index. Hocking said settling trades linked to the shorter-term index would raise practical challenges, but added: “If there is demand we will always explore ways to effectively give the market ways to trade.”
Cboe already publishes a few alternative indices including a nine-day and one-year Vix, but they have struggled to hold the same level of attention as the original.
However, trading groups like Optiver have encouraged the creation of a new index and Hocking said it was developed “to answer customer demand”.
It is also a sign that the exchange expects the recent investor enthusiasm for short-term options to persist, despite concerns from some analysts and regulators that it could be distorting markets and causing sharp intraday market swings.
“[Short term options] is not just a fluke with one use case,” Hocking added. “There are a lot of different people using them, with different use cases . . . I don’t see all of those disappearing overnight.”"
Black-Scholes at 50: how a pricing model for options changed finance,Markets,"The writer is a professor of sociology at Edinburgh university
Fierce hostility was the first reaction to the Chicago Board of Trade’s proposal to set up an organised market in stock options in the early 1970s. There were “absolutely unsurmountable obstacles”, said one Securities and Exchange Commission official, according to the Board’s Joe Sullivan, who once told me that the same official went so far as to make the somewhat tasteless comparison that options were held in the same regard as “marijuana and thalidomide”.
Options are financial instruments giving their holder a right but not an obligation, for example, to buy a block of shares at a preset price. Options were traded in 17th century Amsterdam, but as Sullivan discovered three centuries later, age had not made them respectable: they were suspected of being tools of gamblers and stock-price manipulators.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange nevertheless succeeded in gathering support from, among others, financial economists, and finally opened on April 26 1973. The following month, independently, economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes published a path-breaking journal article on the mathematics of options pricing.
Black and Scholes had not been among the economists recruited to support creation of the new exchange, but having a well-regarded economic model of options “was really what enabled the exchange to thrive”, the CBOE’s former counsel, Burton Rissman, told me. “It gave a lot of legitimacy . . . we were faced in the late 60s-early 70s with the issue of gambling. That issue fell away, and I think Black-Scholes made it fall away. It wasn’t speculation or gambling, it was efficient pricing.”
A third economist, Robert C Merton, made the foundations of Black-Scholes more sophisticated, by drawing upon the daunting maths of probabilistic processes in continuous time to create the model’s now canonical mathematical derivation. Strikingly, too, apparently abstruse mathematics found its way into the Chicago exchange’s crowded trading pits, originally mostly via paper sheets of theoretical option prices sold to traders by Black.
Merton the economist is the son of Robert K Merton, one of the 20th century’s most influential sociologists, who popularised the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy. There is an aspect of that in what happened when his son’s model became part of everyday financial practices.
Plausibly — one cannot be certain — use of Black’s sheets by Chicago traders helped drive patterns of prices towards a key prediction of the model, at least on economist Mark Rubinstein’s crucial tests of the model’s validity. If that is right, the model was “performative”, its practical use shifted reality towards its predictions.
As with any economic model, the assumptions of Black-Scholes, such as that everyone can trade as often as they like without incurring transaction costs, seem unrealistic. However, the 1980s and 1990s saw a vast expansion of “financial derivatives” such as options. Big derivatives traders, such as investment banks, used models akin to Merton’s to price derivatives and analyse the risk exposures of their often huge derivatives portfolios.
Mathematically analysed at the portfolio level, the risk exposures of individual derivatives are often mutually offsetting. A big bank was therefore able to avoid expensively hedging the risk of every individual derivative it had bought or sold, instead hedging only its portfolio’s much smaller net risks. That greatly reduces the transaction costs it faces, again moving “reality” towards the model’s predictions.
But prophecies can be self-negating, not just self-fulfilling. Models can be counterperformative: their use can make reality less like their predictions. That arguably happened in the 1987 stock market crash, which involved price falls that were grotesquely unlikely on Black-Scholes’s assumptions. Those falls were probably exacerbated by portfolio insurance, a strategy that employed Black-Scholes to synthesise a “put”: an option to sell at a preset price.
Portfolio insurance required its users to sell ever more share-index futures as prices fell. Sensible enough when it had only a few users, portfolio insurance employed on a large scale became dangerous. And the 1987 crash ended the period in which option-price patterns followed the Black-Scholes model on Rubinstein’s tests. When he repeated them after the crash, he found the systematic discrepancy that options traders call the volatility skew.
Nor, clearly, has banks’ mathematical modelling of financial derivatives been an unalloyed success. The 2008 global crisis cannot be blamed on exchanges such as Chicago’s or on Black-Scholes. The “collateralised debt obligations” that fuelled it were traded bilaterally among banks and investment companies, not in a Chicago pit, and furthermore could not easily be modelled following Merton’s approach.
The more general lesson, however, still holds. A model, technique or product may not remain valid, safe or beneficial as the number of its users grows. That is something that regulators must remember, especially as they create incentives for a whole market to employ similar models and strategies.

"European bond data costs soar 50% over five years, study shows",Markets,"The cost of data needed to trade bonds in Europe has soared by 50 per cent over five years, according to new data that highlight regulators’ concerns about competition and pricing in the market.
Costs for fixed income data rose by a half between 2017 and 2021, twice as much as overall market data price rises, a study by Expand Research on behalf of industry group Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) found. The increase was largely because of sellers increasing their prices, rather than demands for new kinds of data, the report said.
The report comes as financial regulators review the inner workings of the system for supplying the information that banks and their customers rely on for trading every day. Financial watchdogs are closely scrutinising the charges levied on customers, and AFME plans to submit its findings to authorities.
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has said it has concerns over competition, pricing and availability of information like benchmarks, indices and credit ratings, as well as stock and bond prices that are carried from stock exchanges, trading venues and data vendors.
In Brussels, the European Commission is working on plans to make it cheaper for banks and fund managers to find prices of stocks and bonds throughout the single market, warning that a comprehensive picture is unaffordable to many investors.
Some regulatory mandates require investors to have the most up-to-date and accurate prices, giving users little choice in paying for the information.
Data suppliers have argued that their pricing models have become more tailored to customers’ consumption, while customers also want higher-quality data that require investment.
Interdealer brokers — a type of intermediary that sits between financial groups — levied the biggest price rises, up an average 183 per cent, followed by alternative trading venues, which raised prices by 46 per cent to 107 per cent, Expand found.
The survey by Expand, part of the Boston Consulting Group, found that some of the increase was because of Brexit as Britain’s departure from the EU created duplicated costs.
However, the biggest price rises were for data accessed using terminals, the distinctive trading screens that carry news and real-time prices. As most bond deals are negotiated privately, fixed income trading relies more heavily on evaluated pricing, reference data and research for information, the report pointed out.
“Our latest report finds that fixed income market data costs have increased far beyond those for equity markets, which are already considered to be too high,” said Adam Farkas, chief executive of AFME. “Rising market data costs is a marketwide problem which must be tackled as a standalone issue.”
The EU wants to create central databases that record trading information on stock and bond markets, known as a consolidated tape. But Farkas warned that it would not fix the problem of rising prices. “For a tape to be effective . . . it must be built on cost-effective data,” he said.
European and UK standards require data distributors to provide information “on a reasonable commercial basis”. Last year, Esma, the pan-European regulator, urged authorities to tweak the laws that allowed trading venues to charge for data proportionate to the value that the data represents to users.
AFME argued that pricing should be related to the cost of producing and distributing information. Expand’s research was based on data supplied by ten European fixed income market makers, and publicly available sources."

US stocks advance as debt ceiling concerns ease,Markets,"Wall Street stocks advanced on Wednesday as investors grew more confident the White House would reach a deal with Congress to avoid a government default.
Wall Street’s benchmark S&amp;P 500 closed 1.2 per cent higher on Wednesday, driven by gains in the financial and energy sectors, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent.
The KBW regional banking index gained 7.3 per cent, with lender Western Alliance surging 10.2 per cent after reporting late on Tuesday deposit growth in the current quarter.
US president Joe Biden on Wednesday said he was “confident” about reaching a budget agreement with Congress to avoid a default on US debt, and left the door open to meeting a central Republican demand of adding work requirements to social safety net programmes.
Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has warned the US could default on its debt as early as next month, with the issue prompting Biden to cut short his forthcoming overseas trip.
“If we look at the broader picture, equities are not priced for a devastating scenario. Ultimately, markets expect a resolution to happen,” said Georgios Leontaris, chief investment officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa at HSBC Global Private Banking.
Government bonds steadied from the previous sessions, with the yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury notes rising 0.08 percentage points to 4.15 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 0.03 percentage points to 3.58 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
Yields on the shortest-term bills that mature next month — at about the date the government could run out of money — earlier this week hit their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. The yield on the one-month Treasury bond was down 0.16 percentage points to 5.38 per cent on Wednesday.
One-year credit default swaps, a closely watched measure of US default risk, fell 10.6 per cent to 154 basis points, after having reached their highest point since 2009 at the end of last month.
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six peers, gained 0.3 per cent to its highest level since late March as investors looked to haven assets.
“Certain parts of the market are pricing in a bigger risk than others,” noted Leontaris.
Elsewhere, Target shares increased 2.6 per cent after the company reported that it exceeded earnings forecasts for the first three months of its fiscal year.
However, the Minneapolis-based retailer warned of soft sales in its second quarter and set guidance below Wall Street’s expectations. That near-term outlook echoed other trends in the retail sector, after home improvement retailer Home Depot on Tuesday warned its profits would fall below expectations this year and the Census Bureau reported US retail sales grew less than forecast in April.
Data released on Wednesday showed an uptick in US housing starts, which rose 2.2 per cent to an annualised rate of 1.4mn units.
“Mortgage rates remain elevated, but home builders have found success with rate buy-downs, price discounts and other incentives,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote.
European stocks were subdued, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 falling 0.2 per cent, FTSE 100 down 0.4 per cent, and France’s CAC 40 ending the day down 0.1 per cent.
Traders digested the release of the eurozone’s final harmonised index of consumer prices for April, which posted a slight increase in the annual rate to 7 per cent, up from 6.9 per cent in March.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, dipped 0.1 percentage points to 5.6 per cent.
The European Central Bank slowed the pace of its rate increases this month, raising its deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 per cent, but said it had more ground to cover.
In Asia, China’s CSI 300 shed 0.5 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.1 per cent.

The yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury notes rose 0.08 percentage points to 3.99 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year note was up 0.06 percentage points at 3.46 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
The moves followed the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, which fell more than expected and which showed respondents’ expectations for long-run inflation escalated to a 12-year high, as consumers worried that higher prices could persist for a while.
“Inflationary expectations are tantamount to actual inflation as far as the [Federal Reserve] is concerned,” said Dana Grigg, president of Camelotta Advisors. “It would indicate that the Fed would have to maintain rates at higher levels for longer than the market expected, which would dry up liquidity.”
Investors also considered a report from the US Congressional Budget Office, which warned that if the debt ceiling is not raised, the government could default in the first two weeks of June.
“Background jitters are beginning to emerge around the upcoming debt ceiling deadline,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay. “No one has a technical default as a base case, but prudent market participants are going to avoid taking big directional positions just in case.”
Investor sentiment is being swayed by economic data, with traders looking for signs that the Fed has made progress in cooling the US economy and reducing inflation, and might be nearing the end of its policy of higher interest rates.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has added nearly 20 per cent this year, far outpacing the 8 per cent gain of the S&amp;P 500.
“The anticipation of that peak [of interest rate rises] from the Federal Reserve is supporting tech more than it is supporting anything else,” said Mobeen Tahir, director of macroeconomic research and tactical solutions at WisdomTree Europe.
Michelle Bowman, a voting member on the Fed’s policy-setting commit, on Friday warned recent US inflation and employment data had not convinced her that price pressures were under control and she left the door open to voting for further rate rises.
In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 share benchmark rose 0.4 per cent, aided by strong corporate earnings from Switzerland’s Richemont, which boosted luxury goods makers. France’s CAC 40 added 0.5 per cent, led by strong earnings from French reinsurer Scor.
The gains came despite hawkish signalling from the European policymakers, with the head of Germany’s central bank Joachim Nagel saying eurozone interest rates could still rise in September because of sticky underlying inflation measures.
The European Central Bank last week raised its deposit rate to 3.25 per cent. Most economists expect it to pause at 3.75 per cent in July.
London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3 per cent as official data showed the economy expanding 0.1 per cent between the last quarter of 2022 and the first three months of this year, unchanged from the previous quarter and in line with analysts’ expectations.
The dollar gained 0.6 per cent against a basket of six other currencies.
Equities declined in Asia, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index falling 0.6 per cent and China’s CSI 300 shedding 1.3 per cent. Japan’s Topix was the exception, adding 0.6 per cent. It was buoyed by positive earnings forecasts from some of the country’s biggest companies in recent days."
US stocks hit highest levels in nine months on debt ceiling deal hopes,Markets,"Wall Street stocks rose on Thursday after policymakers in Washington said that a bill to raise the US debt ceiling may be put to a vote next week, raising the possibility of a deal to avoid a government default.
Both the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite reached their highest levels since August 2022, up 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. The remarks on the possible vote next week came from Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who told reporters on Capitol Hill, “We’re not there, we haven’t agreed to anything yet. But I see the path that we can come to an agreement.
“I think we have a structure now and everybody’s working hard. I mean we’re working two or three times a day, then going back getting more numbers.”
“All of this should be taken with a grain of salt,” said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group. “With [Treasury bond] yields on the rise and the US dollar driving higher, we would be concerned about the sustainability of the equity market rally.”
The yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury notes was up 0.1 percentage point to 4.26 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note added 0.08 percentage points at 3.64 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six peers, gained 0.6 per cent.
Meanwhile, data from the US labour department showed applications for new unemployment aid fell to 242,000 claims last week, from 264,000 in the previous seven days.
The figure landed below analysts’ expectations, raising concerns that a tight labour market could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to bring inflation levels back to target.
Corporate results have added to investors’ confusion around consumer spending. Walmart shares were up 1.3 per cent after the world’s largest retailer delivered stronger than expected earnings and raised full-year forecasts for sales growth.
The company stood in contrast to rivals Home Depot and Target, which painted a much bleaker image of US discretionary spending earlier in the week.
In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.4 per cent, recovering from two consecutive down days. France’s CAC 40 was up 0.6 per cent, while Germany’s Dax rose 1.3 per cent.
Asian stocks were also higher, propelled by the momentum from Wall Street. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.9 per cent and Japan’s Topix rose 1.1 per cent.
China’s CSI 300 was the outlier, falling 0.1 per cent, and extended its losses from earlier in the week when official data pointed to a slowdown in the country’s post-coronavirus pandemic recovery."
US stocks make gains but debt ceiling remains in focus,Markets,"US stocks were subdued on Monday as investors awaited news about debt ceiling negotiations and assessed fresh data pointing to a cooling economy.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.7 per cent, extending its gains from the previous week, while Wall Street’s benchmark S&amp;P 500 added 0.3 per cent.
The moves in US equities came as traders were looking ahead to a breakthrough between the White House and Republican lawmakers in talks to raise the federal borrowing limit and avoid a national default, ahead of President Joe Biden’s meeting with Congressional leaders on Tuesday.
The KBW regional banking index, which has been buffeted by the failures of three lenders since March, added 3 per cent.
“The stock market is stuck until we reach a debt-ceiling resolution and until we see more clarity from the regional banking sector, which are the two factors weighing on stocks right now,” said Brad Bernstein, managing director at UBS Wealth Management in the US.
Fresh economic data on Monday added to signs that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rates policy has begun to take effect. The New York Fed said its index measuring manufacturing activity in the state plummeted from 10.8 to minus 31.8 in May, far below analysts’ forecasts of minus 3.8. However, economists urged caution in interpreting the data, saying it could have been influenced by seasonal factors.
The moves in US equities continue a pattern of growth stocks outpacing value stocks since the start of the year, as the Nasdaq Composite has added 19 per cent, compared with an 8.1 per cent advance for the S&amp;P 500.
“Big established technology names didn’t disappoint during the earnings season, and for the most part, offered guidance that was reassuring, something financial markets needed to hear,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
Traders also awaited Tuesday’s release of US retail sales data for April, which will offer a snapshot on the health of the American consumer amid cooling inflation and higher borrowing costs.
The dollar fell 0.3 per cent against a basket of six other currencies, despite data last week showing US consumer expectations for long-term inflation had reached a 12-year high.
In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.2 pre cent, while France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s Dax ended the day flat, having steadied after trading down during much of the session.
Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, reported the eurozone’s industrial production fell by a larger than expected 1.4 per cent year on year in March, after rising 2 per cent the previous month, suggesting the European Central Bank’s tightening campaign was cooling the region’s economy faster than expected.
“It’s still not enough for the ECB to be convinced that its job is done,” said Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies. “They still need to hike more to fight inflation, but the economic data indicates that they are not far from being done.”
Meanwhile, Germany said its wholesale price index recorded its first year-on-year drop since December 2020.
Asian stocks rose, with China’s CSI 300 climbing 1.6 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index adding 1.8 per cent. China’s renminbi fell on Monday to its weakest level against the dollar in two months."
US stocks retreat on debt ceiling concerns,Markets,"Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday as traders looked for signs of a breakthrough to the impasse in Washington over the US debt ceiling.
The benchmark S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6 per cent, reversing its gains from the previous session. Technology stocks were the only sector that recorded gains, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite dipped a more modest 0.2 per cent.
Trading on Tuesday was overshadowed by concerns US President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy would fail to arrive at a deal to increase the nation’s spending limit by the end of Tuesday’s meeting. The meeting ended after the market close on Tuesday with no deal. The US could default on its debt as early as next month if lawmakers fail to reach a compromise.
Government bonds also came under pressure, with the yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury notes rising 0.07 percentage points to 4.07 per cent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was up 0.03 percentage points at 3.54 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
However, yields on the shortest-term bills that mature next month — at about the date the government could run out of money — fell back slightly after hitting their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis earlier in the week.
“It’s clear that investors are still nervous about the issue,” said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. “That’s a big kink at the front of the yield curve, centred around the one-month mark, which is when fears of a potential default are at their highest.”
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six peers, gained 0.2 per cent.
In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 closed down 0.4 per cent, while Germany’s Dax index lost 0.1 per cent and France’s CAC 40 shed 0.2 per cent.
The moves came after Germany’s Zew indicator — a gauge of economic sentiment for the eurozone’s largest economy — plummeted from 4.1 to minus 10.7 in the month to May, its lowest level this year. The reading was well below the forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
“It seems as if investors in Europe are following the paradoxical pattern that bad news on the economy is good news on rates as it would stop the European Central Bank [raising rates],” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.
Asian equity markets were subdued, with China’s CSI 300 index posting a 0.5 per cent fall after official data showed the world’s second-largest economy was failing to regain momentum, despite its reopening after a lengthy Covid-19 shutdown.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat, while Japan’s Topix gained 0.6 per cent and climbed to its highest level in almost 33 years as improvements in corporate governance make Tokyo more attractive to foreign investors."
US stocks slide on debt ceiling and regional bank worries,Markets,"Wall Street stocks fell as US policymakers paused negotiations over the debt ceiling deal and nerves over the health of the US regional banking sector returned.
Investors on Friday bought short-dated US Treasuries and lowered their expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in June after chair Jay Powell warned tighter credit conditions — the result of the turmoil at US banks — may mean the Fed will not have to raise interest rates as high to reach their 2 per cent inflation target.
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers walked out of negotiations to avert a US default. The pause stokes the risk of an unprecedented national default back on the table.
Gains on Wall Street from earlier in the session had evaporated by late morning. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower on Friday, but gained 1.7 per cent in the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent, but chalked up its fourth straight week of gains with a 3 per cent advance.
Following Powell’s comments, pricing in the futures market showed investors were only betting on an 21 per cent chance the Fed would raise interest rates again at its meeting in June. Earlier Friday, those expectations had been about 40 per cent.
The yield on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasury notes rose fractionally to 4.27 per cent, but had swung between gains and losses. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was up 0.03 percentage points at 3.68 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
US regional bank stocks stumbled after CNN reported Treasury secretary Janet Yellen told bank chief executives this week that more mergers in the sector may be necessary. The KBW Regional Banking index fell 2.2 per cent on Friday.
“The biggest news item was the disappointment in Republican negotiators walking out of the meeting,” said Jack&nbsp;Ablin, chief investment officer at&nbsp;Cresset&nbsp;Capital. “I think there had been a fair amount of optimism . . . so that was a setback”.
The greenback fell 0.4 per cent against a basket of peers, while the price of gold, a haven asset, rose 0.9 per cent to $1,975.96 an ounce.
Germany’s Dax rose 0.7 per cent to close at a record high of 16,275 although it gave up further advances as markets turned. Europe’s region-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.7 per cent while France’s CAC 40 added 0.6 per cent, extending gains from the previous session.
“In Europe, and as a result Germany, earnings have done much better than implied by macroeconomic indicators,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Germany’s producer price index for April showed the annual rate of inflation had fallen to 4.1 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in March. The reading was 0.1 percentage points higher than the forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The index in Frankfurt has gained 17 per cent since the start of the year, lifted in part by strong earnings in the industrials sector.
“There were supply constraints, so [Germany] couldn’t produce cars to match demand . . . the semiconductor shortages have really gone away now, so they have been able to increase production,” said Chris Hiorns, a fund manager at EdenTree.
Asian stocks fell, as pessimism over the tech sector stopped the US rally from spreading to the region.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index retreated 1.4 per cent, while China’s benchmark CSI 300 stock dropped 0.3 per cent after weak third-quarter results from tech giant Alibaba damped investor sentiment.
China’s onshore currency fell 0.4 per cent to 7.01 against the US dollar, its lowest level since December after China’s April data showed weak consumer spending and industrial production, as well as record-high youth unemployment. The numbers pointed to a faltering economic recovery following the unwinding of its zero-Covid curbs last year."
Will US retail sales rebound as inflation cools?,Markets,"US retail sales data for April, to be released on Tuesday, will offer insight into the sentiment among consumers as inflation cools.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast that the Census Bureau will report a 0.7 per cent increase in overall retail sales from the previous month, following two months of declines. That will also reverse the drop of 0.6 per cent in March.
Analysts at Credit Suisse expect the increase to be driven by robust spending on cars and fuel. The underlying number, which strips out car-related spending, is expected to be weaker. The broker is forecasting a decline of 0.2 per cent in that metric month over month.
The outlook for retail sales is mixed as continued strength in the labour market and wages is likely to support consumer spending. However, it comes amid expectations of a recession, tightening financial conditions and slowing inflation, all of which tend to crimp spending.
The retail sales data comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week reported that US inflation slowed its rise more than expected in April as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases continue to dent price rises. Smaller increases in prices typically slows the growth of retail spending. Kate Duguid
Japan’s economy is under pressure from an unsteady post-Covid rebound in consumption, faltering real wages and weak demand for its exports.
Real household spending unexpectedly fell 1.9 per cent year-on-year in March, denting the momentum of a recovery under way as the country threw off most of its coronavirus curbs and travel restrictions.
Real wages also notched up their 12th consecutive month of decline, with pay struggling to keep up with inflation, despite attention-grabbing increases from some of the country’s biggest brands. Goods exports, meanwhile, have suffered from weak global demand, particularly from China.
UBS, the Swiss broker, has downgraded its forecast for growth from a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1 per cent, compared with the previous three month period, down from an earlier estimate of 2 per cent.
But it thinks there are reasons to believe economic growth will continue throughout the year. It points to pent-up demand created by the delayed pandemic reopening, the strong potential for inbound tourism and the likelihood of a rebound in real wages as lower import prices ease inflation.
“Ahead, we think the economic recovery will continue even with the headwinds from a slower global economy,” it wrote.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs agree, revising their GDP growth forecast down to 1.1 per cent from 1.7 per cent, based on a “mixed picture” presented by March economic data, but still predicting a “reactive upturn” from the final quarter of the year. William Langley
The Mexican peso has emerged as the best performing leading emerging markets currency this year as high interest rates, an increase in remittances and its proximity to a strong US economy have made it a favourite among investors.
The peso has risen by 10.8 per cent this year to trade at 17.6 to the dollar, its strongest level since 2017. But analysts warn that with a recession looming in the US, it could be close to its peak.
Oliver Harvey, managing director at Deutsche Bank, said the peso looks “among the most expensive” emerging market currencies and he would not expect it to outperform other currencies in the second half of the year, in the way it has done in recent months.
Caution comes as hedge funds have been ratcheting up their bets against Mexico, with $4.8bn government bonds on loan in May, up from a low of $2.7bn in February this year, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
The peso is one of the most sensitive of the emerging market currencies to a slowing of the US economy.
Brent David, senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay, said that a hard landing in the US, driven by debt ceiling concerns or tightening credit conditions, “would be extremely detrimental for the peso”. Mary McDougall"
Notes from the CEO on another failed THG takeover approach,Matthew Moulding,"If you stopped at THG’s announcement that it had terminated talks to sell itself to Apollo, you're missing half the fun.
Matt Moulding, the increasingly embittered founder and CEO of the mascara-to-ping-meals conglomerate, has committed a very long LinkedIn post that explains the reasons why staying listed in London, in spite of its myriad failings, is still preferable to going private. Here are just a few highlights:
Just about every major PE firm has enquired about taking THG private. Usually, nobody finds out. But if there’s a leak, then the Takeover Panel forces an announcement. This is what happened with Apollo.
PE interest isn’t surprising. For the 3 years before IPO, THG shares traded at £3. Having doubled in size we then listed THG at £5 a share in Sep 20. They rose to £8 in the first-year post IPO but, after the Numis led short attacks when they weren’t made a Broker to THG, shares fell to as low as 30p in late 2022.
We're checking with Numis whether it agrees with the characterisation here of “Numis led short attacks when they weren't made a broker to THG”.
The last time THG shares traded at 30p was in 2009, when the Group had £80m Sales and only sold CDs! Today THG is 28 x bigger (and we haven’t sold CDs for years).
THG was a private company in 2009 so presumably he means the post-money valuation on a fundraising. A reminder that THG cancelled flotation plans two years later after discovering that its valuation had been inflated by fraud.
Like with all previous bidders, the Apollo bid wasn’t right for THG. Yes, it allowed existing shareholders to stay invested, with me continuing to run the Group. But Apollo also wanted PE controls, particularly across Beauty &amp; Nutrition where they asked for controlling equity rights.
Like all previous bidders, Apollo were told their bid valuation and structure was unacceptable. Yesterday Apollo set out how they could raise their bid further, ahead of a deadline set by the Takeover Panel. Their latest view on Ingenuity had it as being significantly more valuable than the whole of THG the day before the bid leaked!
No shit! Ingenuity is great. But neither Apollo’s bid price, nor the structure proposed, are in the best interest of THG. Myself, Charles and the Board, supported by&gt;50% of shareholders, all agreed on that.
The LinkedIn post comes with a photo of an injured Moulding that raises the possibility he has literally shot himself in the foot. Metaphorically, time will tell.

London brokers braced for shake-up as equity market languishes,Mergers & Acquisitions,"UK brokers and boutique investment banks are bracing for further consolidation as a stagnant London stock market increases the pressure on an industry whose lifeblood is listings and takeovers.
A dearth of flotations and subdued activity across London’s capital markets has already triggered several deals, including Cenkos and FinnCap, two smaller brokers, striking a £43mn merger in March.
Deutsche Bank then stunned the industry last month by announcing the purchase of Numis, one of London’s largest brokers with more than 150 corporate clients. The acquisition has heightened expectations of further deals and turned the spotlight on the likes of Panmure Gordon, Singer Capital Markets and WH Ireland.
Brokers earn their fees from a range of activities, including trading shares on behalf of clients, selling them research, listing businesses on exchanges and helping companies raise funds.
But the industry has endured a bruising past 12 months, as the combination of rising interest rates, a slowing economy and higher inflation has left the London market short of IPOs. According to data firm Dealogic, the number of initial public offerings in London dropped from 125 in 2021 to 46 in 2022.
As well as the weaker economic backdrop facing the London market, sentiment has also been damaged by UK chipmaker Arm opting to list in New York and CRH, an Irish building materials group, announcing plans to move trading in its shares to Wall Street.
While Deutsche Bank’s deal for Numis was seen as an opportunistic swoop on one of the industry’s stronger players, it has only fanned expectations of more deals. Shares in Numis rival Peel Hunt closed up by more than 15 per cent on the day it was announced.
The takeover came days after a merger between equities research company Redburn, which is owned by investment banking boutique Rothschild, and US-focused broker Atlantic Equities. Redburn said the deal will give clients “broader and deeper research coverage”.
“The small end of the market place is ripe for a roll up,” said the chief executive of one London-based broker. “Combining those brokers with microcap, smaller clients makes sense, you’ve got to have a large mass of them.”
Joshua Maxey, co-founder of research firm Third Bridge, said: “These deals underline the tremendous pressure that cash equities is under at the moment. Deal activity is at a record low and the outlook is uncertain — that is definitely driving more focus on potential M&amp;A. The bet is how long are the acquirers willing to fund a lossmaking business?”
Over the past two decades, previous market downturns have ushered in consolidation. Following the global financial crisis of 2008-09, Belgian bank KBC spun off Peel Hunt, while Middle East investor QInvest took a stake in Panmure Gordon, one of the oldest brokers with a history dating back to 1876.
However, industry executives, bankers and analysts say structural factors are also at play this time, notably the ramifications from the Mifid II regulations that were introduced in 2018.
The rules required brokers and bankers to split out the cost of the equity research they produce for clients from the fees they charge for executing trades. As a result, the fees that equity research commands has dropped by more than a third since Mifid II, according to industry body Euro IRP, squeezing brokers’ bottom line.
Although Deutsche Bank’s pursuit of Numis suggests that Germany’s biggest bank expects an eventual recovery in London listings, the dwindling number of IPOs will probably continue for a while, said Lord Howard Leigh, senior partner of advisory firm FinnCap Cavendish.
“In the listings market, that business has dried up and you’ve got very expensive overheads, so there has to be consolidation,” said Leigh. “It’s always been cyclical, but this one is much more severe. The big change now is the growth of private equity, which people see as an alternative [to listing].”
Some brokers have attempted to get on the front foot by pushing into new business lines and expanding internationally.
Ross Mitchinson, co-chief executive of Numis, said it had made a “concerted effort” to grow a business that provides M&amp;A advice, as well as working on overseas IPOs and helping private businesses with fundraisings. “We’ve definitely done more to diversify our business over the past few years rather than be at the whims of the UK capital markets,” he said.
Earlier this month, Numis said that “capital markets volumes are likely to remain relatively low over the near term” although it noted the second half “may see relatively better conditions”.
Kunal Gandhi, a senior managing director at Fenchurch Advisory Partners, said other struggling brokers will also be working to cut their reliance on the equity market for revenues.
“There’s growing recognition by brokers of the need to have access to more than principally listed equities as the primary product to service clients,” he said.
But pushing beyond equities is unlikely to be a quick fix, paving the way for more deals. As one broker chief executive said: “It’s been a dreadful 18 months and it feels like that’s going to continue for a little bit longer.”"
"M&A crackdown a ‘disaster’ for pharma sector, Pfizer executive warns",Mergers & Acquisitions,"A senior Pfizer executive has warned that a crackdown on mergers and acquisitions by antitrust regulators would be a “disaster” for the system of innovation that underpins the pharmaceutical industry.
William Pao, Pfizer’s chief development officer, said M&amp;A is an important part of the funding ecosystem that supports the development of innovative therapies by scientists.
“I think it will be a disaster for the system,” he said on Wednesday when asked what impact a tightening of the antitrust regime would have on the sector.
“If you can’t get those M&amp;A [deals] and then get those molecules distributed across the globe, it stifles innovation for sure,” said Pao, who heads the Pfizer arm responsible for clinical development of drugs and ensuring a pipeline of new therapies.
His comments came after the US Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sued to block Amgen’s $28bn takeover of Horizon Therapeutics. It marked the first time in more than a decade that the US competition regulator has sought to halt a deal in the pharmaceutical sector.
Analysts have warned the FTC action threatens to upend a decades-long business model pursued by large pharmaceutical companies, which often rely on buying small and midsize biotech groups to replenish their drug pipelines.
“The FTC filing a lawsuit to block this deal will dampen M&amp;A enthusiasm across the biotech sector, particularly given the lack of direct portfolio overlap between Amgen and Horizon,” said Matt Phipps, analyst at William Blair, an investment bank.
Several analysts have said that Pfizer’s proposed $43bn purchase of Seagen, announced in March, could also come under threat from the FTC.
Pao, speaking at the Financial Times US Pharma and Biotech Summit in New York, said he was confident the FTC would approve the Seagen deal. Pfizer on Tuesday raised $31bn in a jumbo-sized bond sale that will help fund the takeover.
Earlier at the conference, Amgen chief executive Robert Bradway expressed confidence his company would succeed in closing its acquisition of Horizon despite the FTC’s opposition.
Amgen and Horizon have both said they will try to fight the FTC in court in order to complete the transaction.
The FTC argued that Amgen could use the rebates it pays on its “blockbuster” drugs to press insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers into paying for two of Horizon’s medicines: Tepezza for an autoimmune condition that affects the eyes and Krystexxa for a rare type of gout.
If Amgen were to own these medicines and use its market clout to convince payers to cover them, it could discourage other companies from launching rival medicines that would eventually bring down the price, the FTC said. Tepezza costs approximately $350,000 for a six-month course of treatment, while an annual supply of Krystexxa costs $650,000, according to the agency.
Pfizer’s bond deal on Tuesday was the fourth biggest of its kind, numbers from Dealogic show. The order book stood at roughly $85bn, according to people familiar with the details.
The eight-part borrowing, spanning maturities from two to 40 years, topped Amgen’s $24bn issuance in February. According to the terms of the bond sale, if the Seagen deal does not go through on time, or at all, Pfizer would redeem most tranches of the bonds and reimburse investors. But two of the bonds — maturing in 10 and 30 years’ time — will not be subject to those requirements.
Dan Mead, head of the investment-grade syndicate at Bank of America — a lead bookrunner on the Pfizer bond sale — said it was “not uncommon to see that for financings”.
“Issuers often will have financing needs beyond the M&amp;A financing, where they may want to continue to have that debt outstanding if, for whatever reason, the merger or acquisition doesn’t go ahead,” Mead said."
TPG pushes into credit investing with $2.7bn deal for Angelo Gordon,Mergers & Acquisitions,"TPG has agreed to buy debt and real estate manager Angelo Gordon for $2.7bn as the US private equity group diversifies into credit-based investments with its first major acquisition since going public last year.
The acquisition of New York-based Angelo Gordon, one of the largest investors in private credit markets and a savvy distressed debt player, will be predominantly made in stock.
TPG said it will pay $970mn in cash and the remainder in stock by issuing 62.5mn new shares in a deal it forecast would increase its fee-based earnings by as much as 10 per cent next year. In first-quarter results released on Monday, the buyout group generated $99mn in fee-related earnings, generally beating analysts’ forecasts.
TPG listed its shares last year as part of a growth push by the $137bn-in-assets group that many expected would help it acquire a credit-based investment manager, broadening its portfolio that is mostly focused on growth-oriented corporate buyouts and its “Rise” platforms focused on sustainability and climate-based investments.
Angelo Gordon, which manages $73bn in assets with 650 employees worldwide, has had important roles in steering recent bankruptcies such as Revlon and Envision Healthcare. It also has extensive operations financing real estate.
TPG, which went public in January 2022 at a $9bn valuation, slightly higher than its current market capitalisation, hopes to use its bigger size to appeal to the large pools of capital that increasingly prefer to deal with a limited number of investment managers.
TPG co-founder James Coulter said in an interview that Angelo Gordon has an expansive presence in credit markets that would bring the buyout group scale and be welcomed by clients.
Josh Baumgarten, co-chief executive of Angelo Gordon, said the firm’s decision to sell came as its investors were looking for “strategic” relationships with a smaller number of firms. “The world is moving towards larger, scaled and fully diversified businesses that can meet what clients are looking for,” he said.
The combined company expects to capitalise on new investment opportunities that emerge from rising interest rates and a looming credit crunch that could spark a rise in defaults, said chief executive Jon Winkelried.
The transaction comes as private credit managers increasingly replace traditional banks in financing buyouts and even in making large real estate and corporate loans. The deal adds to a wave of consolidation in private capital as asset managers look to bolster their credit investment capabilities.
Several large debt groups have been acquired in recent months and another prominent player in the sector, Fortress Investment Group, is expected to be acquired by Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund, the Financial Times reported last week.
TPG had a partnership with the credit specialist Sixth Street Partners, which the sides terminated in 2020.
Shares in TPG rose 2 per cent on Monday."
Bloomberg is contemplating life without its founder,Michael Bloomberg,"“Time for you to leave,” Salomon Brothers’ cigar-chomping chief executive John Gutfreund told Michael Bloomberg. With the $10mn he got as compensation for being fired, Bloomberg started a company, Innovative Market Systems, the next day. It was 1981, and computers were finally starting to take over Wall Street. Bloomberg, then 39, thought the time was ripe for a product that gave people access to all conceivable financial information and for software enabling anyone, even traders, to crunch it. He was right.
To many people outside finance, Bloomberg is a media company. That is a little like describing Disney as a theme-park operator or Google as an email provider. Out of Bloomberg’s more than $12bn of annual revenue, only about $500mn comes from media, according to people familiar with the matter. The vast majority of its profits come from banks and investment companies renting “the terminal”, its clunky-but-powerful data and analytics portal. From this beachhead, Bloomberg has expanded into trading infrastructure, legal analytics, regulatory technology, public policy and more. It has claimed one-third of the roughly $37bn global financial data and analytics market for more than a decade.
Bloomberg, the company, has made Bloomberg, the man, vastly wealthy. His $94bn fortune — as estimated by Forbes since Bloomberg News’ billionaires index doesn’t track its owner — means that only Warren Buffett has ever made more money out of the business of money. If data really is the oil of the 21st century, then Michael Bloomberg is today’s John D Rockefeller.
And yet, it’s remarkable how little scrutiny the core business of one of the world’s most valuable private companies receives. Bloomberg LP is a data behemoth so enmeshed with the financial industry that it may be of greater importance than any single investment group. This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former executives, rivals and major clients. They reveal a company increasingly consumed with the question of Bloomberg after Bloomberg.
In February, Michael Bloomberg turned 81. People with knowledge of the company’s internal dynamics and its founder suggest he is likely to transfer ownership of his empire to a trust that will finance Bloomberg Philanthropies for perpetuity, similar to the move recently made by Patagonia’s founder Yvon Chouinard. That would be one of the largest charitable donations in history. “He has committed to giving the company away to Bloomberg Philanthropies when he dies, if not sooner,” company spokesman Ty Trippet told the FT.
According to most insiders, Bloomberg’s likely successor as CEO is Jean-Paul Zammitt, a company veteran. Yet some note that a new internal contender has recently emerged and that the mercurial Bloomberg might also look outside the company when he finally steps back, as he did when he left to be New York mayor in 2002. “Mike asks his senior leaders every time they meet if they have more than one successor, and while he has succession plans for himself, he has not discussed them with anyone,” Trippet said. But as the finance industry continues to be transformed by changes to technology and new ways of working, a question even more urgent is coming to the fore: what comes after the terminal?
S&amp;P Global’s senior executives had already begun&nbsp;drafting the triumphant press release. It was 2014, and they were acquiring Barclays’ bond index business for more than $1bn. Financial benchmarks aren’t exactly sexy, but as the reference point for trillions of dollars worth of investment funds, derivatives and structured products, they are profoundly influential and incredibly lucrative. S&amp;P had managed to beat numerous giants to win one of the industry’s crown jewels.
Then Bloomberg showed up. While Barclays owned the indices, Bloomberg supplied much of the underlying historical data. S&amp;P executives tried to negotiate a licensing deal but never seemed to get anywhere. Without an agreement, they’d be buying a house without most of the land on which it was built. “Every night it was one step forward, and every day it was two steps back, until it all fell apart,” says one person involved in the talks. “It was dirty.”
It was also classic Bloomberg: private, patient and cut-throat. A year and a half later, the company announced it was buying the Barclays indexing business for a discount price of $781mn. Bloomberg declined to comment on the deal, or to make executives available for interviews for this article, underscoring how the company prizes privacy as a competitive advantage.
The Barclays deal was the company’s most aggressive gambit to date, as it branched out from its dominant business of renting out terminals. Today, there are about 365,000 Bloombergs on the desks of investment bankers, bond traders, equity analysts, pension fund managers, sovereign wealth funds and central bank officials. Every day, the terminal processes an average of more than 300 billion bits of financial information and sends about 1.4 billion messages and 30 million “Instant Bloomberg” chat messages that ricochet around the world.
The investment bank Merrill Lynch was the first to take a gamble on Bloomberg’s promise that he could build a one-stop shop for all financial data and analytics. Back in 1982, Merrill promised to pony up $600,000 in development costs for what was then dubbed “Market Master”, but only if the start-up succeeded in delivering on time. When Bloomberg came through, Merrill agreed to pay $1,000 a month for each of the first 22 terminals it would take.
Ever since, the terminal has been the sun around which the company has revolved. Everything Bloomberg LP has done centres on how to make the terminal more valuable, whether it is building out a chat function, starting a news organisation, setting up bond-trading protocols, adding funky alternative data like geolocation for tanker ships, scooping up social media chatter from Twitter or even setting up a high-end classifieds site. Over the years, its design has changed from a blocky desktop PC, accompanied by a complex, colour-coded keyboard, to a lithe multiscreen set-up, accompanied by a complex, colour-coded keyboard.
It may not be as glamorous as many other corners of the technology world, but Bloomberg terminals have become an essential part of any self-respecting bank or investment group’s toolkit. Some executives insist on having their own as a condition for accepting a job offer. “I’ve been married to the Bloomberg terminal for longer than I have my wife,” says Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, who has had one since he started his career at Salomon Brothers in the late 1980s.&nbsp;
The company’s ability to charge for the privilege of renting a terminal is the envy of the data industry. Last year, Bloomberg raised the price for just one of its terminals by about 9 per cent to $30,000 ($2,500 a month) and the cost of multiple ones to $26,580 per unit, as reported by the FT. Because the company refuses to cut deals, even for its biggest clients, and because of how rare it is to get rid of one once they’re installed, that means the annual revenues thrown off by the terminals over the next two years are easy to calculate: at least $9.7bn.&nbsp;
Bloomberg LP is a private company almost wholly owned by its founder and not required to make any public financial disclosures. But insiders and industry analysts say its profit margins are enviable. It has many rivals in each segment it operates, including the London Stock Exchange’s Refinitiv, financial data provider FactSet, bond-trading platform MarketAxess and the Symphony messaging system. But customers say, even if they are cheaper, none of them can touch Bloomberg’s overall integrated offering. “If it’s already on your desk, you can’t get rid of it. There is no really good alternative,” complains the CEO of one major Bloomberg client, with more than 100 terminals installed. “I have respect for their non-negotiable terms. I don’t like it, especially when I have to write them a big cheque every month, but I respect it.”
Even a global financial crisis couldn’t put a major dent in the terminal business. After the wipeout of many investment banks and money managers, the number of terminals being rented globally shrank from 285,000 in 2008 to 279,000 in 2009, according to people familiar with the matter. But Bloomberg’s overall revenue grew slightly, thanks to those steady price increases and other revenue streams. By the end of 2010, the terminal count had risen above 300,000 for the first time.
Everything is built for the terminal and is on the terminal. At one point, Mike didn’t even see the need for a website
How thoroughly the Bloomberg terminal has wormed its way into the fabric of the financial system was clear in 2015, when a brief outage forced the UK debt management office to postpone a bond sale. Finance Twitter was predictably mocking. But any long-lasting outage could have serious consequences. “It’s a critical aspect of Bloomberg’s business,” says Richard Berner, a finance professor at NYU Stern and former director of the US Treasury’s Office of Financial Research. “It’s not just important that the system functions 24/7, but also that it’s secure.”&nbsp;
Bloomberg LP’s quirky corporate culture — a mix of aggressive drive and gnawing insecurity — reflects Bloomberg’s idiosyncrasies. Company lore has it that the founder loves aquariums because watching the fish sedately swim through the water is like someone massaging your eyes at times of stress. Whether that’s true or not, many of Bloomberg’s 176 offices have at least one large saltwater aquarium. Almost every one of them is open plan and equipped with a canteen, the idea being that everyone should see everyone else work and no one should ever have to leave.
Employees’ comings and goings are monitored, and everyone must wear a lanyard with their work badges, after Bloomberg sent a memo insisting the policy be observed when he returned from serving as New York mayor in 2014. “Mike is pretty hands-on,” says one former executive. “He wanted to see everyone’s names. It was important to him. He has a desk like everyone else, walks around like everyone else and grabs coffee like everyone else.” Even at 81, he appears to remain the same hands-on CEO who once said Sunday night was his favourite time of the week because he knew he would soon have “five full days of fun in the office”. People at the company say he is still in most days from about 7am, and still routinely gets involved even in minutiae like desk configuration and the canteen food selection.
There are other big personalities. Peter Grauer, a former Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette banker, is the statesmanlike chair and especially active in courting and maintaining big clients. Grauer met Bloomberg through their daughters’ equestrian events and has been schmoozing clients ever since he was first appointed to the board in 1996. Michelle Seitz, the former chief executive of Russell Investments, says that Grauer called immediately when she announced that she was leaving the asset manager last year. He wanted to offer his congratulations — and ensure she had uninterrupted access to her terminal as she launched her new firm. (This is a common Bloomberg tactic.) “Their customer service is world class,” she says.
Co-founder Tom Secunda, who worked with Bloomberg at Salomon Brothers, has long overseen engineering and technology. Although the terminal might not have his name, he is widely considered its spiritual father. “Tom is the heart of the product,” according to one senior former executive. “Tom is the [Steve] Wozniak to Mike’s Steve Jobs. He even looks a little like Wozniak. Anything major built into the terminal still gets signed off by him.”
Alongside this trio, there are a handful of other top executives on Bloomberg’s management committee and an assortment of other senior executives jostling for a seat at the top table. Over the years, many Bloombergers have described Bloomberg’s management approach as “cats in a bag”. There is a constant struggle to see who emerges, scarred but alive. Ultimately, there is just one person who really matters. “Mike is kind of like God at the company,” Dan Doctoroff, whom Bloomberg installed to run the company while he was mayor, once told an interviewer.
Some say for better and worse. One issue that has dogged Bloomberg and its founder for decades are repeated claims that its culture is hostile to women. In 1990, the company’s former marketing chief Elisabeth DeMarse presented Bloomberg with a book of his “wit and wisdom”, including quotes like “make the customer think he’s getting laid when he’s getting fucked”, calling a competitor a homophobic slur and making sexually explicit jokes, according to a report in The Washington Post. When Bloomberg entered the presidential race in 2019, Business Insider counted nearly 40 employment lawsuits from 65 plaintiffs that had been lodged against Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg personally in state and federal courts since 1996, mostly over discrimination based on gender, race and disability. Bloomberg declined to comment on the lawsuits. In the past, a company spokesperson denied the founder “said the things somebody wrote in this gag gift”.
Kat Tatochenko, a former Bloomberg executive, notes that there is still a paucity of women at the top — at least when it comes to the core financial data business. But she stresses that she never saw or experienced any discrimination and argues that “Mike gets an unfair rap” about hostility to women. “They’ve gotten really good,” she argues. “There are a bunch of very strong women coming up the senior management ranks; they’re just not at the top top levels yet.”&nbsp;
Bloomberg LP is now having to contemplate a world without its sun king. His closest lieutenants are also past the age when most people retire: Grauer is 77 and Secunda is 68.
Last year, the company offered a glimpse of what that future might look like, with a reorganisation that elevated the two people whom insiders say are most likely to lead the company once Bloomberg exits for good. Jean-Paul Zammitt, a taciturn British-Italian Bloomberg veteran who has overseen the terminal sales business for years, was made chief commercial officer and picked up some of Grauer’s customer-facing responsibilities. Vlad Kliatchko, a computer engineer originally from Russia, was named chief product officer, in charge of all of Bloomberg’s technology, engineering and data operations.
Bloomberg also elevated Patti Roskill, then chief financial officer, to be the company’s new chief enterprise officer and put her in charge of co-ordinating the management committee that runs the company. Roskill is a former accountant at Geller, which had worked for Bloomberg LP since its founding until Bloomberg simply bought its entire 300-strong outsourced CFO business in 2021. That makes Roskill one of the most senior women in the Bloomberg empire, alongside Patti Harris, who runs Bloomberg Philanthropies. John Micklethwait, the former Economist editor who runs Bloomberg News, is not considered a contender and does not sit on the management board.
According to people with knowledge of the company’s management dynamics, the person currently most likely to follow in Bloomberg’s footsteps is Zammitt. Kliatchko is often seen as playing the Secunda role. Yet several insiders note that important Bloomberg LP divisions have lately been moved under Kliatchko’s aegis, positioning him as a viable contender. And some think Bloomberg could easily shake things up by going outside the company for a CEO. “There are only two people that really run the company after the reorganisation, JP and Vlad . . . [But] he has no need to go internally,” says one former senior executive. “Mike believes in stability, and then change.”
Bloomberg himself nodded to this in his memo announcing the reorganisation last year. “The world is changing, and the second derivative of change is positive. We have lots to be proud of but the biggest threat to our livelihoods is complacency caused by our success,” he wrote. “I know change is hard for us all, but better we drive the process than let competitors do it.”
Many analysts and people inside Bloomberg LP are unconcerned by the prospects of a founderless future. They point out the company’s cultish culture, experienced management and the fact that Bloomberg was gone for more than 12 years during his stint in politics, with little meaningful disruption. “Mike could die tomorrow and the company would run like clockwork for another 20 years,” says one former executive. “People would freak out, but the guardrails have been set down.” Robert Iati, managing director at Burton-Taylor, an industry consultancy, concurs. “There’s always a risk when the founder goes away, but I think it is less of a risk at Bloomberg than at many other companies,” he says. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Mike Bloomberg is probably not a ‘keyman’ risk.”
Not everyone is so certain. Some former Bloomberg executives point out that former CEO Doctoroff made a lot of changes that were quickly aborted when Bloomberg returned from City Hall. For example, in 2009 it launched a sports analytics division only to sell it when the Mike 2.0 era began. Whoever ends up taking the reins when Bloomberg exits permanently is probably going to be an aggressive, confident executive with aspirations to do more than just maintain the status quo after surviving years of “cats in the bag” management testing.
To use Doctoroff’s metaphor, what happens to Bloomberg LP when its God is no longer around? “At the end of the day, every business is a people business, even in technology. When the people at the top change, organisations change,” points out Kevin McPartland, a top industry analyst at Coalition Greenwich. “Someone has to be behind the wheel, and at Bloomberg that has always been Bloomberg himself. When he is no longer around something surely will change, even if his successor isn’t going to rip up the playbook.”
Then there is the future for the Bloomberg terminal, the bedrock of the company’s strategy and corporate culture since day one. If Bloomberg LP was sentient, the terminal would be its id. “All we ever talked about was the terminal,” observes one former executive. “The terminal is front and centre. It’s all about the terminal. Everything is built for the terminal and is on the terminal. At one point, Mike didn’t even see the need for a website. It’s all part of the mystique of the terminal.”
Right now, even rivals seem resigned. No one talks of “Bloomberg killers” any more, unless it is sardonically. Many companies still compete with Bloomberg in every arena where it is active, but the reality is that few rivals are gung-ho about dislodging Bloomberg from the bedrock of the financial data world. “They have all the desktop space you could ever dream of. They have the data. They have the analytics. They have the electronic trading, and now they have the indices,” says the CEO of one Bloomberg competitor, sighing. “People have expected them to lose market share my entire career. I’m now late in my career, so I’m going to say it’s not going to happen.”
In an embryonic way, the transition away from the physical terminal is already under way, something reflected by its slower growth over the past decade. Many clients use their own hardware and only rent the terminal’s idiosyncratic keyboard, designed specially for Bloomberg software. In 2004 the company launched “Bloomberg Anywhere,” which allows clients to log on from any computer they please with a biometric identity card called “B-Unit”. (It costs the same, naturally.) Since last year, they’ve been able to use a phone app. Usage has exploded since Covid-19 lockdowns.
People have expected them to lose market share my entire career. I’m in my late career, so I’m going to say it’s not going to happen
There are also other corners of the Bloomberg empire that are becoming more meaningful, supplementing terminal sales. For example, the media business has gone from only supplying the terminal’s clients with terse news on recondite subjects to a swish subscription offering whose breadth competes with publications ranging from The Wall Street Journal and the FT to USA Today. Last year its overall number of news and magazine subscribers grew about 20 per cent to 450,000. The “Industry” group — Bloomberg Law, Bloomberg Tax and Bloomberg Government — has almost doubled revenues over the past decade to $450mn in 2022, according to people familiar with the matter.
Perhaps most importantly, the company has also been building a separate data sales business, which pipes raw data directly to clients that neither need nor want a terminal subscription, called B-PIPE. One former insider estimates this business now probably makes about $2bn a year. As a result, non-terminal business generates about one-third of Bloomberg’s overall $12bn of revenues, up from 20 per cent when Bloomberg returned in 2014.
The company is also looking to lessen its dependence on finance. In January, Zammitt set up a new division dedicated to selling Bloomberg products to companies in other fields. It has long leased terminals to corporate America’s chief financial officers, treasurers and investor relations staff. Now it wants to reach much deeper, targeting corporate strategy departments and anyone else who might need data and analytics. “It is prudent to be more deliberate in developing revenue streams that are differentiated from our financial services business,” Zammitt wrote in another memo obtained by the FT. “I believe there are far more avenues of opportunity and new services we can develop to extend our reach and revenues even further.”
A broader unbundling is anathema to Bloomberg’s corporate culture. But that may become increasingly problematic. “People now want to buy data by the bite, they don’t want bundles any more,” says Iati. If the shift towards more pick-and-choose data marketplaces keeps growing, it will be hard for Bloomberg LP to adjust.
One former executive observes that most of Bloomberg’s top lieutenants have been there for a long time and are very process-oriented. When it comes to running a huge organisation where stability is a matter of global financial importance, that is important. But it can make them “a bit robotic and discourage creativity”, the executive observes. “Bloomberg says it wants you to take risks [but] in reality it’s pretty hesitant to do so. So how do you transition this behemoth into the new world we are entering, where people just want access to data and do their own analysis? That’s something that is difficult for Bloomberg to get comfortable with.”
For years, people inside and outside Bloomberg have played “fantasy M&amp;A”, imagining potential Bloomberg acquisitions, primarily media targets such as The New York Times, the FT and, more recently, The Washington Post or Dow Jones. At times, speculation has even linked deep-pocketed companies such as the exchange behemoth ICE, Amazon and Google to buying Bloomberg.
It remains a popular parlour game, even if Bloomberg is now too big for any one other company to digest. However, some analysts think a&nbsp;change at the top could trigger a more unsentimental look at what the company wants to keep doing. “I think Bloomberg would actually be more valuable in parts than as a whole,” says Iati. “If Mike is no longer in the picture — but no one can swallow a $80bn business — you might see his successor peel some parts of it off or that Big Tech tries to buy parts of the core.”
While Bloomberg might throw a curve ball at the end of his career, most observers say he is likely to transfer his ownership of the company to something like a “Perpetual Purpose Trust”. This would be overseen by friends and family, such as his daughters Emma and Georgina, and its profits would go to Bloomberg Philanthropies. This is what Patagonia’s founder Chouinard did last year, albeit on a much smaller scale. Patagonia estimates that it will give $100mn annually to its trust; in 2021 Bloomberg Philanthropies doled out $1.66bn.&nbsp;
Bloomberg is fond of pointing out that his mother lived to 102 — a record he hopes to beat. If so, Bloombergers might still have to face another two decades of lanyards, no offices and fish staring at them at work, and executives contemplating carving up the behemoth will be further frustrated. The multibillionaire loves to revel in how many competitors he has bested over the years, from Telerate and Quotron in the early days to more recent rivals, including Thomson Reuters. But he has also noted that “we went against giants, and giants are usually easy to beat”. Today, his company is the biggest giant of all.

How to invest for a greener future,Money Clinic with Claer Barrett,"Your browser does not support playing this file but you can still download the MP3 file to play locally.
Following the COP26 conference in Glasgow, many climate-conscious investors want to know how to match up their investments with their values.&nbsp;
The short answer is environmental, social and governance investing — ESG for short. But there are plenty of questions around how ‘green’ this really is.
Thirty-year-old Harri appeared on one of the first episodes of Money Clinic last year, and his decision to invest in ESG funds appears to have paid off: he has made a decent return. However, he wonders how much this has been down to the underlying investment performance and how much because of the soaring popularity of ESG investments. With a record $3.9tn now held in sustainable assets worldwide, is this outperformance sustainable?&nbsp;
Claer is joined by the FT’s Manuela Saragosa and Share Action’s Catherine Howarth, who have put ESG investing to the test. They offer practical tips on how to make greener choices with your pension,Isa and becoming an activist shareholder. Plus, they debate how worried investors should be about ‘greenwashing’.&nbsp;

"EU gas derivatives market becoming less transparent, watchdog warns",Natural gas,"More deals in Europe’s €4tn natural gas derivatives market have moved off-exchange since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as squeezed companies try to save trading costs, the European Union’s securities watchdog has warned.
A report on Friday by the European Securities and Markets Authority found the share of trades on the opaque over-the-counter market had jumped from 15 per cent last summer to 27 per cent this year, shifting from the regulated futures exchanges.
The agency said the change had been driven by energy groups and may have been linked to a push to save the margin used for trading. Producers and traders that rely on futures markets to hedge against volatile price moves and lock in supply months in advance were last year loaded with sharply rising demands for margin.
The prices of gas in Europe rose to record levels following Russia’s invasion and were exacerbated by scorching temperatures. The European benchmark TTF started the year at about €90 per megawatt hour, but in the summer traded at more than €300/mwh, and ended the year at about €75/mwh. Prices have fallen further since the start of the year, on Friday touching €32.25/mwh, as European storage is filled with an unusually high amount of gas for this time of year.
However, the margin payments, demanded by exchanges as insurance to secure deals, more than doubled in 2022, according to the European Central Bank. That forced many companies to draw on credit lines with their banks, seek emergency funds and conduct more trades privately, where margin requirements are lower.
The EU also brought in a cap on the price of gas traded on exchange but exempted the over-the-counter market. Analysts had warned last year, when the EU was drafting the price cap, that trading would migrate to over-the-counter markets.
While most trades are still being conducted on exchanges, the shift to OTC “raises concerns due to more limited transparency and more bespoke margin and collateral requirements in that market segment”, Esma said.
The volatile market pushed annual turnover of natural gas derivatives on EU futures exchanges to €4.1tn last year, with open positions of EU companies amounting to about €500bn, the authority said.
However, it also found the market was becoming increasingly concentrated as funds exited and left banks and energy companies as the main traders. “Some energy firms hold relatively large derivative positions,” Esma found.
The EU has warned that its price cap could be pulled if too much trade moves to over-the-counter deals that are “less transparent, less subject to regulatory scrutiny, and carrying greater risks of defaulting on obligations for the parties involved”.
Intercontinental Exchange, which operates the main trading hub for gas in the EU, opened a gas contract in London as insurance against disruptions in the EU market, but few traders, apart from a few early tests, have made much use of it."
Gold miner Newmont seals $19bn deal for Australia’s Newcrest,Newmont Corp,"The board of Australia’s Newcrest Mining has unanimously backed a A$29bn (US$19bn) takeover offer by its US rival Newmont, paving the way for the world’s largest gold miner to strengthen its grip on the sector.
Subject to a shareholder vote and regulatory approval, Newmont will acquire Newcrest — which it originally founded in the 1960s before spinning off through a merger with BHP — with an offer of 0.4 shares for every share in the Australian company.
The deal will strengthen Denver-based Newmont’s operations in Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea and potentially create a ripple effect in the industry as smaller mines owned by the combined business are shed.
It is the latest example of consolidation within the global mining industry as major companies look to buy promising operations to increase scale and exposure to critical minerals needed for the energy transition. Newmont’s move significantly increases its exposure to copper and follows BHP’s takeover of rival Oz Minerals, Rio Tinto’s buyout of Turquoise Hill and Allkem’s merger with Livent to create a more substantial lithium player.
Newmont first approached Newcrest in February with an all-share offer but was rebuffed. It raised its bid in April to A$29.4bn, which led Newcrest’s board to open its books.
The slightly lower value of the deal, which includes debt, reflects a decline in Newmont’s share price in the past two months but still amounts to a more than 30 per cent premium on where it stood just before the initial offer was made.
US-listed Newmont’s chief executive Tom Palmer, an Australian who hails from the mining town of Broken Hill, said the takeover represented “exceptional value” for shareholders. “It creates an industry-leading portfolio with a multi-decade gold and copper production profile in the world’s most favourable mining jurisdictions,” he said.
The deal comes against a backdrop of gold prices rising to near record highs as banking sector issues, a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve and uncertainty around the US debt ceiling boosted gold’s safe haven status, said ANZ bank.
Rahul Anand, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said in a note: “We see the deal, if approved, yielding operational synergies around project sequencing and growth optionality, as well as the combined entity increasing its diversification of operations in low-risk jurisdictions.”
Palmer said due diligence had identified synergies of $500mn that the company expected to achieve within two years of the deal completing, as well as opportunities to enhance cash flow by $2bn in that period.
Newcrest will pay a final dividend to shareholders as part of the takeover agreement. The combined business will retain a secondary listing on Australia’s stock exchange."
Norway’s $1.4tn oil fund to step up ESG proposals to US companies,Norway's Oil Fund,"Norway’s $1.4tn oil fund will step up its use of shareholder proposals to send messages on environmental, social and governance topics to US companies after quietly testing them out at a small number of annual meetings.
The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund filed shareholder proposals on climate for the first time this year at four US companies but did not publicise them until now, its head of corporate governance told the Financial Times.
Two companies — Packaging Corporation of America and Marathon Petroleum — gave commitments on climate so the fund withdrew its proposals while in two others — NewMarket and Westlake — the annual meeting voted on the oil fund’s motion.
“It was a new thing for us. It’s a test case with four companies,” said Carine Smith Ihenacho, the Norwegian fund’s chief corporate governance officer.
She added that the fund considered the trial a success and would probably step up use of shareholder motions in the future.
“We would like to do more on climate but also consider other areas across the ESG spectrum,” she said. “It will most likely be in the US.”
Norway’s oil fund is one of the most influential investor voices on ESG, owning on average 1.5 per cent of every listed company in the world.
For decades it was worried about being too outspoken as a shareholder, but in recent years it has taken a more active stance, becoming the first big shareholder to declare how it will vote at the annual meetings of all 9,000 companies it owns five days in advance.
It is also stepping up its demands for all companies to set various targets to ensure they have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and its four test proposals this year asked the selected businesses to do that.
“The beauty of it is that sometimes we see shareholder resolutions where we agree with 70 per cent, or 40 per cent, or 80 per cent. With this we get our views out there,” Ihenacho said.
She underscored that filing a shareholder motion was a last resort, and particularly suited to companies in the US, both because it was easier to file proposals there and because American companies lagged behind their European counterparts in ESG matters.
“I see the shareholder proposal as a very nice add-on. It may become quite an important tool. It is nice to be able to formulate our own proposal to companies. With the experience we have had we definitely see it as a strong add-on,” she said.
But she stressed that voting “consistently” at annual meetings and dialogue with companies and their boards would remain the most important tools. “We will never reach that many companies with our proposals. It is a time-consuming and resource-intensive tool,” she said.
At NewMarket, a producer of lubricant and fuel additives which has a free float of 72 per cent, the oil fund’s proposal received the support of 28 per cent of shareholders, with 60 per cent against and 12 per cent abstaining. Westlake, a chemicals and plastics company, will disclose the results of last week’s annual meeting by Wednesday.
The fund filed 21 shareholder proposals at 13 US companies between 2009 and 2015 on proxy access and splitting the role of chief executive and chair, but has not filed one since and had not previously done so on climate.

How Iran will profit from Shell’s Iraqi gas project,Oil & Gas industry,"An Iranian company is the biggest beneficiary of a power plant poised to supply a Shell-backed gas project in Iraq, showing the pervasive presence of Tehran’s business interests in its neighbour and putting the UK group at odds with the west’s shifting geopolitical priorities in the Middle East.
Basrah Gas Company, which is 44 per cent-owned by the London-listed energy major, will become a major consumer of power from Rumaila Independent Power Plant in southern Iraq when the gas company’s new facility starts operations in June.
The Rumaila plant is owned by Jordan-based Shamara Holding but was built by Tehran-based Mapna Group, which is entitled to 78 per cent of the revenue from electricity sales, according to documents seen by the Financial Times and three people involved in the contracts.
Shell’s joint venture, which has received World Bank funding, has been widely praised for its role capturing gas that was previously flared at Iraq’s oilfields and processing it for use in local power generation, cooking or export. Iraq’s state-owned South Gas Company owns 51 per cent of the project and Japanese trading house Mitsubishi owns 5 per cent.
Shell and Basrah Gas both said they had no dealings with Mapna. There is no indication that payments from Basrah Gas for power from the Rumaila plant, made via Iraq’s ministry of electricity, will violate US or European sanctions on dealing with Iran.
However, Mapna’s role in the power plant reflects the extent to which companies close to the Iranian regime have become embedded in the fabric of the Iraqi economy.
“Iran’s interests and influence run deep into the Iraqi state and its ministries,” said Renad Mansour, director of the Iraq initiative at Chatham House. “Its long-term investments and networks ensure it remains the most influential foreign power.”
Iran’s reach is especially entrenched in energy, where 20 years after the US-led invasion, chronic under-investment and corruption has left Iraq heavily reliant on imports of Iranian gas and electricity, which provide more than a third of its power needs.
This is not only an issue for Shell. Several international oil companies, including BP and ExxonMobil, run oilfields in Iraq that pull power from Iraq’s national grid.
Mapna’s construction of the Rumaila plant is perhaps the best example of Iran’s penetration of the sector. It also reflects how the west has vacillated on its rules of engagement with Tehran over the past decade, complicating operations for foreign investors in Iraq.
When Mapna was selected to help build the Rumaila plant in 2015, Iran was about to sign a nuclear deal with western powers, and relations were improving. Three years later US president Donald Trump pulled out of the deal and reimposed sanctions.
The contract to develop the 3,000 megawatt Rumaila plant was awarded to Shamara in 2014, backed by a power purchase agreement with Iraq’s ministry of electricity. The company initially hoped to work with a US or European partner but struggled to generate interest as Isis fighters swept across parts of Iraq and Syria that summer, prompting western investor interest to cool, according to a person familiar with the early stages of the project.
At the same time, two years of negotiations between western powers and Iran on a nuclear deal had opened the possibility for renewed engagement with Iranian companies, the person said.
Mapna was ultimately awarded a $2.05bn contract to build and deliver the key technology for the Rumaila plant, backed by an Iraqi government payment guarantee signed on July 9 2015 — days before the west’s nuclear deal with Iran.
Mapna, a power and infrastructure group founded in 1993, is one of Iran’s most successful companies and the investment in Rumaila was championed by the Iranian regime. The plant received support from the Export Guarantee Fund of Iran in the form of a $300mn political risk insurance policy and is described on Mapna’s website as the company’s “largest international power project”.
The Shell joint venture agreed to take power from the Rumaila plant in 2019, signing a $35mn contract to build an 18km power line to a natural gas liquids (NGL) facility it was building nearby, according to documents shared with the FT by Unearthed, an investigative journalism group backed by Greenpeace.
The Basrah NGL plant is due to start operations in June and will pull up to 70MW of power from Rumaila, which could increase to 200MW as the NGL facility is enlarged.
The Rumaila plant has been producing up to 1,500MW of power since 2020. The ministry of electricity is the sole provider of power in Iraq, meaning it acts in effect as a middleman at the Rumaila plant, paying Shamara and Mapna for the power produced and selling it to customers such as Basrah Gas.
Shamara collects 22 per cent of the revenues, while the rest flows to Mapna as repayment for its work on the project, according to the documents and the three people involved in the contracts. Shamara declined to comment.
Shell stressed that it had “no dealings with Mapna or any Iranian entity”, adding that it could not comment on the ministry of electricity “infrastructure, flow of funds or their commercial arrangements with third-party suppliers or offtakers of power”.
It also defended its participation in the Basrah Gas joint venture, saying that it was “founded as part of the solution to enhance Iraq’s energy self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on gas imports”.
Mapna, South Gas Company and Iraq’s ministry of electricity did not respond to requests for comment. Mitsubishi referred questions to Basrah Gas.
Basrah Gas said it only paid the ministry of electricity for power and had no dealings with Mapna and no contract with Shamara other than the agreement in 2019 to build the power line. “BGC’s integrity due diligence on Shamara Holding did not highlight any concerns related to sanctions or trade compliance laws,” it said.
But Mapna’s role in the project is contentious. A former prime ministerial adviser and another person familiar with the matter said that Iraq, under US pressure, had frozen the Iraqi account into which Mapna receives funds since 2021. As a result, Mapna has delayed finishing the plant, which was designed to generate 3,000MW once complete.
The US has been concerned, among other issues, with the role that Hassan Danaeifar, a former Iranian ambassador to Baghdad and former member of the country’s Revolutionary Guards, has played in lobbying Baghdad on behalf of Mapna, the people said. Danaeifar could not be reached for comment.
“The US and Iraq are working together to modernise Iraq’s financial system, combat corruption, and prevent manipulation of the financial system,” the US State Department said in response to questions about Mapna. It added that the US was focused on “enhancing Iraq’s energy security” by supporting the country to advance gas capture projects to reduce emissions and generate power, construct regional interconnections and modernise electricity infrastructure.
The transfers to Mapna’s account are not the only energy-related payments between Iraq and Iran to have encountered problems. US sanctions waivers allow Iraq to import gas and power directly from Iran but Baghdad’s payments can only be used by Tehran to fund purchases of food or medicine or for other authorised international transfers. This arcane arrangement helps Iraq to meet domestic power demand but means its payments to Iran are often delayed, prompting Tehran to occasionally turn off supply.
“The sanctions have created a Catch-22 for Iraq,” said Yesar Al-Maleki, Gulf analyst at Middle East Economic Survey. “Washington understands that [Iranian gas and power imports] are crucial for the country’s political and social stability and continues to allow import waivers. But the limitations on transferring the payments to Iran mean that they are building up in Iraq.”"
Oneok to buy Magellan Midstream in $19bn US pipeline deal,Oil & Gas industry,"US pipeline giant Oneok is set to buy Magellan Midstream Partners for $18.8bn, creating one of the biggest oil and gas infrastructure companies in North America as consolidation in the hydrocarbon business gains pace.
The deal, announced on Sunday, will create a company with an enterprise value of $60bn and a sprawling 25,000-mile network of pipelines stretching from North Dakota to Texas.
Pierce Norton, chief executive of Oneok, described the transaction as “transformational”.
“The combination of Oneok and Magellan will create a diversified North American midstream infrastructure company with predominately fee-based earnings, a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility focused on delivering essential energy products and services to our customers and continued strong returns to investors,” he said.
The deal comes as a cash-rich US oil and gas sector looks to pick up dealmaking after a lengthy dry spell. It will give gas-focused Oneok a big foothold in the crude and refined products market, which the company said would ensure “stable cash flows through diverse commodity cycles”.
The shale revolution, which turned the US into the world’s biggest producer of both oil and gas, has begun to fade as Wall Street demands operators focus on shareholder returns over endless drilling campaigns, making mergers and acquisitions one of the few ways to expand their footprint.
There were a handful of big-ticket deals struck late last year. Diamondback and Marathon Oil shelled out $3bn apiece to acquire land in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins. Another roughly $5bn worth of deals were done across the sector in January, including Matador Resources’ purchase of private equity-backed Permian driller Advance Energy for $1.6bn.
Bankers and lawyers have forecast a “wave” of consolidation among drillers and pipeline operators this year as shale companies try to eke out gains in a sector that may be entering an era of lower growth.
“To me, it signifies a return to fewer larger companies controlling the US oil and gas business,” said Andrew Gillick, a managing director at consultancy Enverus. “Consolidation in the twilight of shale makes sense.”
New pipeline projects have become increasingly difficult to build in recent years as they are dragged through lengthy legal challenges in the courts. Lawmakers in Washington are looking to thrash out an overhaul of the clunky permitting process.
“Everyone built out the pipeline infrastructure for the shale revolution,” said Raoul LeBlanc, vice-president of North American upstream at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.
“Now that shale is in harvest mode and it is nearly impossible to build new pipelines, it is not surprising to see big mergers taking place — period. Expect more,” said LeBlanc.
Magellan shareholders will receive $25 cash and 0.67 Oneok shares for each unit of stock they hold, representing a 22 per cent premium to the company’s closing price on Friday.
“We believe the premium offered maximises value creation for Magellan’s unit holders and reflects the essential nature of Magellan’s assets and service offerings,” said Aaron Milford, Magellan’s chief executive.
The deal, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of the year."
The energy mega-deal stuck in the pipeline,Oil & Gas industry,"This article is an on-site version of our Energy Source newsletter. Sign up here&nbsp;to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday
Hello and welcome back to Energy Source.
Energy will be near the top of the agenda as leaders from the world’s top economies gather in Japan this week for the G7 summit.
My colleagues reported over the weekend that European leaders want to ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow has cut supplies, which would escalate the energy war. If enacted, the move would put a significant barrier up for any potential energy rapprochement down the road. Japan’s climate strategy, which leans heavily on hydrogen and ammonia, will also be under scrutiny.
In today’s newsletter, I look at a big pipeline deal between Oneok and Magellan Midstream, and what it says about the profound shift under way in the American energy landscape. Amanda looks at US rules aimed at bringing solar and other clean energy supply chains back to the US. They’re raising more questions than answers.
Thanks for reading — Justin
Oneok’s mega-deal to buy rival pipeline builder Magellan Midstream for $19bn went down like a lead balloon with the company’s investors.
Oneok’s shares closed down 9 per cent yesterday, following the purchase announcement on Sunday.
The deal would create a new pipeline behemoth worth about $60bn. But investors are questioning the commercial logic from Oneok in stepping out of its core natural gas transportation business to buy Magellan’s crude and refined fuels pipelines. It will be difficult to wring efficiencies out of the disparate businesses, analysts said.
Executives at the companies, both of which are based in the tight knit oil and gas community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, will have a hard sell in the coming weeks. But the deal also speaks to broader shifts under way in the US energy landscape.
The shale boom era caused a surge in US oil and gas production that transformed the country into an energy superpower; hundreds of billions of dollars were spent drilling new wells during this period.
For pipeline builders — the so-called midstream part of the industry — the peak shale era brought its own wealth of opportunities. As gushers of oil and natural gas suddenly erupted in places such as North Dakota and Pennsylvania, the US needed a vast expansion of the plumbing that moves fuel around the country. Cue a decade-plus long boom that led to thousands of miles of new pipelines.
The growth story is not over in the US oil and gas patch — but the associated pipeline building bonanza has largely run its course and an increasingly inhospitable regulatory environment has waylaid a number of big projects. That makes acquisitions one of few remaining paths to growth.
Or as Raoul LeBlanc, a vice-president at S&amp;P Global Commodities Insights, told Myles:
“Everyone built out the pipeline infrastructure for the shale revolution. Now that shale is in harvest mode and it is nearly impossible to build new pipelines, it is not surprising to see big mergers taking place — period. Expect more.”
Now, pipeline companies are starting to think about how their fossil-fuel dependent businesses will fair in the energy transition.
That has some companies starting to look for new growth in moving around low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and biofuels or transporting carbon dioxide from carbon capture and storage projects — although none of those businesses really exist at any scale today.
Pierce Norton, Oneok’s boss, told analysts on Monday that the new company’s bigger size would make it better prepared for the big changes coming down the pipe.
“Scale does matter going into the future, especially going into wherever energy is going,” Norton said on a call with analysts.
“As far as hydrogen and . . . renewable fuels, those kind of things that can move through these [pipelines]. The future is going to determine that. It’s going to be determined by what the customers are desiring and the cost. But having these two companies combine sets us up for that opportunity,” he said.
The scale of the transaction — and the fraught energy politics of the moment — mean the deal will draw a sceptical look from the administration of Joe Biden.
The president took aim at the oil and gas industry as high fuel prices drove up inflation last year — and has told regulators to be on the lookout for price gouging or other evidence of collusion leading to higher prices. It has also said it wants to curb corporate power more broadly.
This will be the biggest deal in the oil and gas industry to come before the administration and will no doubt come under the microscope.
The Federal Trade Commission, which has taken a more adversarial position under its leader Lina Khan, has been scrutinising shale gas producer EQT’s $5.2bn deal to buy private producer Tug Hill for months on anti-competition grounds.
Analysts at UBS say the deal faces “limited risk” from regulators. But it will be closely watched across an industry primed for a wave of big deals. (Justin Jacobs)
The Biden administration sent the solar industry into disarray on Friday when it released confusing tax credit rules for developers that use US-made materials.
The landmark Inflation Reduction Act included a 30 per cent investment tax credit for clean energy developers, with an additional 10 per cent bonus if they use domestic products. But to qualify for the bonus, at least 40 per cent of the project costs must come from US-made components. This proportion increases to 55 per cent after 2026.
The tax credit reflects the administration’s twin goals of decarbonising quickly while simultaneously reducing reliance on Chinese supply.
Up until Friday, developers weren’t sure how the Treasury would define a US-made product. While the new guidance won’t have much of an impact on the pace of solar deployment, it will influence how the US supply chain for solar takes shape.
“When you look at all these companies that have made announcements to open factories in the US, this [guidance] is going to slow them down,” said Jim Wood, chief executive of SEG Solar, a module manufacturer in Houston. Wood expects his company’s modules to qualify for the bonus credit.
Here are three takeaways for the solar industry:
The new rules do not explicitly say solar cells have to be made in the US, but it will be hard to qualify for the full tax credit if they are made elsewhere given cells make up the bulk of production costs.
Because the US solar supply chain is in its infancy, hardly any developers will qualify for the full tax credit. The US has virtually no cell production and only produced enough modules to meet half of demand in 2022, according to Wood Mackenzie.
The Biden administration’s guidance pleased few folks. While developers were frustrated they were locked out of the full tax credit, a handful of politicians and industry groups were angry the government didn’t take a tougher stance.
The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition called the guidance a “missed opportunity” to spur production in upstream components like polysilicon and wafers. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin said the guidance “rewards” the continuation of Chinese dominance.
It’s hard to say a ruling isn’t strict enough if it would immediately render most modules ineligible for the full tax credit. If the US truly wanted to make a political statement with its subsidy, it could require all components to be domestically sourced, but that would make it even more difficult for developers to use US products in the tax credit’s 10-year timeframe. Plus, upstream manufacturers have their own IRA subsidies to monetise.
Friday’s guidance might be so stringent that it disincentivises domestic product consumption. Calculating product costs will require developers to request more information from their manufacturers, many of whom don’t have this information.
“The domestic manufacturers who wanted to force more of the materials to be made in the US got their way, but it’s not administrable,” said Keith Martin, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, who predicts that the manufacturers who can offer cost clarity will charge products at a premium.
By contrast, south-east Asian modules are cheaper and readily available. Wood Mackenzie estimates a US-made module with a US-made cell will be 42 per cent more expensive than a module from south-east Asia delivered in 2025.
“Why go through all the hassle of trying to secure capacity that doesn’t even exist right now?” asked Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “From a purely economic perspective, it makes more sense to continue importing the module.” (Amanda Chu)

The ESG world is turning more to private investments,On Wall Street,"It did not matter to climate change activists that Citigroup and Bank of America held their annual shareholder meetings online this year. Protesters showed up at the banks’ offices anyway to rail against fossil fuel lending. Extinction Rebellion demonstrated outside Citigroup’s headquarters in Tribeca in New York in late April. And at the same time, activists challenged the financiers walking into Bank of America’s Bryant Park offices.
Apparently, the noisiness fell on deaf ears. This year, shareholder resolutions at Citi and BofA demanding the banks stop financing new fossil fuel projects won less support than they did in 2022.
The shift echoes a broader trend in other types of climate-related votes. Across corporate America, there are signs of scepticism over so-called Say on Climate votes asking shareholders to approve climate transition strategies, says Glass Lewis, a shareholder advisory firm. It says while shareholders of US companies were among the first to propose a Say on Climate vote in 2021, none of these proposals were approved, with support ranging from 7 per cent to 39 per cent.
“That scepticism appears to have turned to indifference, as there were no shareholder proposals on this topic at US companies in 2022,” it said in a report in March. “It is likely that the momentum around this issue has essentially ceased for the time being at North American companies.”
At this point in the annual meetings season, it is too soon to know whether support for other types of climate shareholder proposals has been sapped this year. But two years after the tiny hedge fund Engine No. 1 shocked the world with a victory to elect directors to the board of ExxonMobil, the early voting results suggest climate advocacy by shareholders is not the force it was in 2021.
At the same time, investors have cooled on dedicated funds that invest with environmental, social and governance mandates. In April, Goldman Sachs was warned that one of its ESG equity funds might be delisted because it had not attracted enough investors. And more generally investors have pulled billions from sustainable funds this year.
This is partly because of performance. For a decade, US ESG large-cap equity funds were among the best performers in the stock market. But this year, ESG funds globally have underperformed the market as “ESG darlings” in clean energy have suffered amid a flight to safety, AllianceBernstein said in a May 3 report.
Apart from performance issues, some investors with ESG goals are also reaching for other asset classes. Until now, equities have been the bread-and-butter for ESG investors. Now there are more alternatives for investors seeking to make an impact.
“The most activity around sustainable investing is really happening in the private markets,” Jonathan Hirschtritt, a managing director of sustainability at GCM Grosvenor, told an ESG conference last month in New York. His Chicago-based alternatives manages about $74bn of assets.
The supply of investable projects in clean, renewable energy has expanded thanks to the climate incentives in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. And not a week goes by without a private equity firm launching a new impact investing fund in an effort to take a slice of the sustainable investing market. This is despite political headwinds such as bans in states such as Oklahoma, Florida and Texas on government pension funds being invested with ESG mandates.
“Ignore what you read,” said Michael Kashani, head of ESG credit at Apollo, told the New York ESG conference. Despite negative ESG headlines in America, “the biggest increase in [ESG] questions is from the US”.
Securitisation is another growth area in ESG. A few years ago, this was a novelty. Now, sustainable securitisation is becoming mainstream, says asset manager TCW. The firm is eyeing opportunities in solar panel leases that can be securitised and sold to investors who want diversity away from corporate issuers while also prioritising a sustainable objective, says Jamie Franco, co-head of TCW’s sustainable investing. The firm is also talking to banks about asset-backed securities based on car loans dedicated to electric vehicles.
There are weaknesses for sustainable investors in asset classes beyond stocks. Investors have complained that the private funds’ impact reports remain considerably anecdotal without the metrics needed to evaluate how much good investments are doing. The threat of “impact washing” — where firms claim they are greener than they actually are — cannot be addressed without better disclosures than are being demanded in public markets.
But for the pension funds, endowments and family offices that are increasingly demanding investments that support ESG goals, there are at least more options.

The WhatsApp showdown between SEC and money managers,On Wall Street,"US regulators have been on the warpath about WhatsApp and private messages since they discovered that traders and dealmakers were using these “off-channel communications” but their employers weren’t saving them.
When the enforcers complained that this would hamper future investigations and lawsuits, the big investment banks including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Barclays capitulated. Twelve of them have paid out more than $2bn in penalties so far.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has now turned its attention to private equity and hedge funds. Apollo, KKR and Carlyle have all disclosed they are under investigation and several hedge funds have also been asked to review their employees’ personal phones for evidence that they talked to clients.
But this time the industry is pushing back. Ten trade associations combined forces last month to write to SEC chair Gary Gensler complaining that the commission is “attempting to exceed its authority . . . and engaging in rulemaking by enforcement”.
The difference lies in the nuts and bolts of US financial regulation. The SEC supervises everyone involved in the buying and selling of securities, but the rules for various parts of the investment universe can be quite different.
Big bank capital markets divisions fall under the rules for broker-dealers, which tend to be quite strict and prescriptive, while investment managers that run hedge funds and private equity operate under a less intrusive regime. Products aimed at retail customers are much more tightly regulated than private funds aimed at wealthy and institutional clients.
In the case of record-keeping, for example, US law says that broker-dealers must keep “all communications . . . relating to business as such”. But investment managers operate under a narrower regime that details the kinds of exchanges that must be preserved.
The lobbyists argue that treating investment managers the same way as broker-dealers is unfair. And they fear that the current sweep will uncover chats that should have been preserved. If so, an individual firm may opt to settle with the SEC and agree to put in place expensive new record-keeping requirements that other industry participants will feel obliged to follow.
“Their approach is purposefully antagonistic to the industry,” says Jennifer Han, chief counsel of the Managed Funds Association, which signed the letter.
But regulation by enforcement isn’t the only thing that the investment management industry objects to about Gensler’s SEC. The industry is also highly exercised by efforts to tighten the rules through the ordinary regulatory process.
Since Gensler took office, the commission has proposed a string of new requirements for investment advisers on a wide variety of topics, from outsourcing and cyber security to fee negotiations with clients. Many of these are quite specific about how the problems should be addressed and disclosed.
To the industry, this specificity marks a big departure from the historic practice of relying on a more general duty of care. They say it will push up costs and penalise responsible managers who already have procedures and systems in place because they would have to overhaul them to match the requirements.
“What has been proven to be deficient?” asks Tamara Salmon, of the Investment Company Institute, the main mutual fund industry group. “If we can document it, then by all means let’s fix it. But rulemaking for the sake of rulemaking is to nobody’s benefit.”
Some industry participants fear the flurry of rule proposals will simply lead to a further erosion of the differences between the way broker dealers and investment managers are treated and encourage the commission staff to crack down even more.
“They’re setting the stage for more enforcement activities by the SEC . . . They are laying out more and more landmines and foot faults,” says Brian Daly, a partner at Akin Gump who advises investment managers.
Consumer groups see it quite differently. “Bad behaviour is covered by a duty of care, but that’s inadequate,” says Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets. “Some firms shouldn’t be able to profit from under-compliance. [Clear rules] level the playing field.”
Taken together, it’s a bit contradictory. The investment managers are arguing the SEC should pass more prescriptive rules if they want instant messages preserved, while claiming that other detailed requirements are intrusive and expensive. But regulators do need to strike a balance: protect investors without sapping their returns.

The dollars are not fragile,On Wall Street,"The writer is an FT contributing editor
This week the US is again negotiating with itself to make sure the federal government can continue borrowing. The stakes are familiar. And yet this time there seems to be more concern that the dollar itself is at risk — that everyone else, long frustrated with the US currency, might take the chance to stop using it.
The problem with that argument is that there is no such thing as the dollar. There are many different kinds of dollars, each with its own qualities. No monetary regime lasts forever. But monetary regimes aren’t collective delusions, either. Dollars will not all suddenly blow away like smoke if Argentina starts pricing soyabeans in renminbi. Each kind of dollar has its own value, and we should be precise about which ones are in danger.
Normally when we talk about a currency we actually mean bank deposits. Dollar strength is a measure of the desire among currency traders to swap deposits in some other country for deposits in the US. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has made it clear through repeated crises that it will not let any deposits fail, period.
There is no other currency with anything like the FDIC’s explicit guarantee of $250,000 of deposits, or its implicit guarantee of evidently pretty much anything. Eurozone bank deposits, for example, are backed only by national governments, and only to €100,000. You may not like American bank dollars, but there is no currency that might conceivably replace them.
There are also eurodollars — dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks. These, too, enjoy an almost explicit guarantee from the Federal Reserve, through agreements to temporarily swap currencies with foreign central banks in a crisis. No other central bank offers anything remotely comparable to the assurance of these swaps. You might not like this system, but again, it’s not clear what could replace it.
In financial markets, treasuries function as dollars — they aren’t just denominated in dollars, they are dollars. If the federal government starts to miss payments, the value of successive runs of treasuries might dip below par. That, in turn, would eat away at the market values of even responsible asset portfolios. It would be bad. Treasury dollars are at risk.
Starting at least with the Bank of England’s charter in 1694, however, sovereign debt has remained the bedrock of the global financial system. You may not like this system — I have some questions about it myself — but it is the one we have. And here, sheer volume is an under-appreciated strength of the treasury dollar.
Americans think of treasuries as debt, and measure them as a percentage of gross domestic product, so they can argue about what kind of debt load might be sustainable. But as Michael Pettis points out, everyone else in the world thinks of treasury dollars as assets, and no other country has been willing and able to produce sovereign debt assets at anything close to America’s volume.
Add up local and federal government borrowing and America had pushed $26.9tn in sovereign debt assets into global financial markets by September of 2022, according to the most recent comparative data from the Bank for International Settlements. (Yes, I know the Fed also holds treasuries.) China and Japan come next, with just over $8tn each in sovereign assets in their own currencies. Very few other countries even measure their sovereign debt in trillions.
We think of America’s ability to borrow in the mighty dollar as a privilege, but it’s possible the opposite is just as true. America’s enthusiastic willingness to borrow helps make treasury dollars mighty. You may no longer wish to hold treasuries in your portfolio. That’s fine, but what else are you going to hold?
All of these dollars, together, help explain the “bill of lading” dollar — shipments of goods abroad, priced in dollars. Traditional currency theories argued that goods were priced in the currencies of where they were coming from or going to. More recent work has pointed out that exporters pick dominant currencies, because stable prices are more important than sovereign currency advantage.
Dollar prices on bills of lading are stable, in turn, because of all of those other kinds of dollars. You can believe that oil priced in dollars is purely a product of American aircraft carriers, but the petrodollar alone does not explain the global evidence of dominant currencies.
There are many reasons to be sceptical of whether strong dollars are good for America. All those treasury sales don’t seem to have paid for much productive investment, just periodic tax cuts and stimulus programmes. But you don’t have to like all of these dollars to see that it’s not at all clear what the other choices are."
Former OpenSea employee convicted in first NFT insider trading case,OpenSea,"A 32-year-old former product manager at OpenSea has been found guilty of fraudulently purchasing non-fungible tokens he knew would sharply increase in value, in the first conviction for what prosecutors described as insider trading of digital assets.
Nate Chastain, who worked at OpenSea — then the largest platform for buying and selling NFTs — was charged last year in New York with wire fraud and money laundering.
US prosecutors claimed he had bought 45 tokens over the course of approximately five months that he knew would surge in popularity once they were displayed on the site’s homepage, only to sell them soon after for between two and five times the price he paid.
The transactions were first flagged by a Twitter user in late 2021, and Chastain’s scheme was subsequently confirmed by OpenSea, which pledged to tighten its controls.
“He cheated, he stole, and he lied,” assistant US attorney Allison Nichols told jurors in closing arguments on Monday. “He saw a way to make some extra money, to capture some upside”.
She referred to messages from Chastain presented at trial in which he referred to having “FOMO” or “fear of missing out” when not buying NFTs that were set to balloon in value.
Chastain’s lawyers argued that there were “no policies, no training, no guidance” at OpenSea prohibiting the defendant from buying the NFTs in question, and that such rules were only put in place once Chastain’s transactions became a public matter.
They pointed out that when confronted by a Twitter user about his transactions in August 2021, Chastain publicly responded that he had bought a particular NFT because he “wanted to secure one of these before they all disappeared [to be honest]”.
“He told the world, and the world didn’t care — he got likes,” defence counsel Daniel Filor, of law firm Greenberg Traurig, said in closing arguments.
Prior to the week-long trial, Chastain’s lawyers had argued that an “insider trading” case required the involvement of securities or commodities, labels that they claimed did not apply to NFTs. Chastain’s actions, they said, were akin to an employee of an art gallery promoting their own painting and fetching a higher sum for it as a result.
At its peak, OpenSea facilitated more than $3.8bn in NFT transactions per month on its platform, according to data from DappRadar, with some digital artworks selling for millions of dollars. Volumes have since dropped considerably, to $200mn over the past 30 days.
In a statement shortly after the verdict, David Miller, a lawyer for Chastain, said: “We respect the jury process and appreciate the jury’s time and effort. We disagree, however, with the jury’s verdict and we are evaluating our options.”
Chastain, who was found guilty on both counts, faces a maximum of 40 years in prison. He will be sentenced at a later date.
Chastain “exploited his advanced knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on OpenSea’s website to make profitable trades for himself,” Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said. “Although this case involved trades in novel crypto assets, there was nothing particularly innovative about his conduct — it was fraud.”
While the verdict marks a significant win for the US attorney’s office, it does not necessarily pave the way for a wave of NFT insider trading cases.
“I am not sure it opens the floodgates because the charges here and the verdict really stayed away from whether an NFT is a security,” said Joshua Newville, a partner at Proskauer.
“I would assume the jury decided that this is property that OpenSea was taking some steps to protect.”"
Fido’s money hoover wins again,Passive Investing,"Earlier this year, Alphaville wrote about how State Street’s $380bn flagship (and industry-pioneering) ETF might be overtaken in assets by competitors from BlackRock and Vanguard. But it already has been by a different type of rival.
Take a look at this:
Strictly speaking, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund is not an ETF like State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (or BlackRock’s iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF or Vanguard’s S&amp;P 500 ETF).
SDPR — often just known as “Spider” — is also comfortably the most heavily traded equity security in the world, and has a huge web of derivatives based on it. So this isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison, at least when it comes to the value of the franchise.
But it’s pretty remarkable how fast Fidelity’s S&amp;P 500 index fund has grown recently. A decade ago it managed just $57bn, and five years ago it was $146bn. At the end of April it managed $388.6bn, compared to SPDR’s $385.8bn.
(NB, the Vanguard ETF is just a share class of its Vanguard 500 index fund, which combined is easily the biggest of them all, with $821bn of assets under management. No one is ever going to catch up with that.)
There’s no real secret as to why Fidelity has now leapfrogged the main S&amp;P 500 offering of its Boston rival: cost — charging just 2 basis points compared to BlackRock and Vanguard’s 3 bps, and SPDR’s 9.5 bps — married with Fido’s vast distribution.
It’s often easy to just think of Fidelity as an asset manager. It’s their oldest and biggest business, after all. But the reality is that it’s a sprawling, multi-faceted machine designed to constantly hoover up money from people, companies and organisations in the world’s biggest economy and funnel it into investment products.
Fidelity’s latest report said that it had 38mn individual retail accounts, 42mn workplace accounts, and $11.1tn of client assets on its various platforms — $4.2tn of which is in actual Fidelity funds. Even last year, when markets were pretty dicey across the board, Fidelity soaked up another $466bn of net inflows.
That Fidelity’s single biggest fund is now an index fund will tickle anyone who remembers how viciously the company lambasted passive investing in its early days, and how grudgingly it eventually started dabbling with them (initially under a separate brand to avoid tarnishing the Fidelity brand with tawdry passive funds).
The artist formerly known as the Spartan 500 index fund is now almost four times bigger than Willian Danoff’s Contrafund and more than fifteen times larger than the once-imperious Magellan Fund. What would Ned Johnson make of that?

"Levelling up push may hit investment returns, warns UK pension chief",Pensions industry,"A UK government push to persuade local authority pension funds to plough billions of pounds into levelling up projects may conflict with trustees’ duty to secure the best returns for pensioners, one of Britain’s largest town hall schemes has warned.
Gordon Ross, chief investment officer of LGPS Central, told the Financial Times that any required target to invest in projects aimed at regenerating needier areas of the country “may not always align” with schemes’ investment obligations. LGPS Central, which invests on behalf of a pool of eight local authority pension funds in the Midlands, has a combined £55bn of assets.
His comments come as the government prepares to publish its plans for increasing local investment through town hall funds. Ministers have set out plans to tap more than £16bn of cash in local authority pension funds by setting an ambition for these retirement schemes to invest up to 5 per cent of their portfolios in projects that help “level up” poorer areas.
The proposal — first outlined in a government White Paper last year and reiterated in the Spring Budget — is part of a wider push by the government to unleash capital held by institutional investors, such as leading retirement funds, to help drive fresh investment into local projects, such as infrastructure, housing, regeneration and small business finance.
“LGPS funds are global investors and their governing bodies have to ensure that their investments will meet their fiduciary duties and provide the outcomes that fund members and employers need,” said Ross.
“As such, mandation of any specific&nbsp;investment or asset class may not always align with these needs, and every investment will need to be looked at very carefully through a risk and return lens.”
The £342bn Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) — which serves around 6mn council workers in England and Wales — invests in a wide range of assets, including in the UK and globally.
Ross said many town hall funds already had investments in the UK and added that allowing funds to invest in levelling up projects around the country, rather than just locally, would open “a broader set of opportunities”.
Investment consultants to local government schemes said many town hall funds were already investing in projects, such as social housing and infrastructure in the UK.
But they noted that unlike other public sector pension plans, such as the NHS, teachers and firefighters, which are funded by taxpayers, pensions for local council workers are funded by contributions from scheme members and sponsoring employers or local councils. More than 18,000 employers participate in the LGPS in England and Wales.
“Investment returns are therefore very important for local government schemes,” said Iain Campbell, senior investment consultant with Hymans Robertson, a professional services firm.
“Every pound not earned from investments means a pound of contributions that may have to come from members, or employers. For the councils, this may mean less money to spend fixing potholes.”
The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said further information on its proposals would be published “in due course”."
"How to invest in wind farms, motorways and mobile phone masts",Personal Finance,"It’s official. A chunk of your pension should be in infrastructure.
That is according to the government and the financial regulator, which have spent six years finding a way for pension funds to diversify into assets such as roads, bridges and airports, alongside other types of illiquid assets that cannot be bought and sold quickly, notably private equity.
Now the first Long-Term Asset Funds (LTAFs) have started to go live, so savers can begin investing.
The main reason for holding infrastructure when investing for retirement or any other long-term goal is diversification — the need to not have all our eggs in one basket. With stock market volatility far from over, infrastructure bulls are claiming the sector looks attractive, offering an inflation hedge and an alternative to sometimes unpredictable equities.
They point to the sector’s potential to align with investors’ environmental, social and economic considerations, with key types of infrastructure playing a central role in building a greener future.
Plus, the sector is set to benefit from the UK government’s £650bn infrastructure investment programme; elsewhere, other governments are launching similar schemes, including US president Joe Biden’s $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure law and the EU’s Global Gateway.
But, as bears of the sector point out, a fair wind for infrastructure projects does not guarantee plain sailing for investors. Governments are often guided more by politics than economics, fall out with private partners and change policies with elections. There is a long list of schemes with cost overruns, management disputes and technical failures.
So, investors need to take care. But the LTAFs’ launch suggests the time is ripe for a good look at infrastructure. FT Money investigates.
Infrastructure investment covers water, energy, roads, airports, railways, ports, satellites and communications systems. It includes education, border security and healthcare. Or as Ed Simpson, the head of energy and infrastructure at investment advisers Gravis, neatly puts it: “The basic physical structures and facilities that are needed for the operation of society.”
He says investments in schools, hospitals and renewable energy generators can be considered lower risk than assets exposed to the economic cycle. “Even during the pandemic, when people were not going to schools, these assets continued to earn revenues — they were paid for having the assets available, regardless of whether they were in use.”
This defensive capacity is a powerful draw, with proponents also pointing to infrastructure’s lower volatility (or less bumpy ride) compared with global equities. Infrastructure equity performed better during years of weaker equity performance such as 2011, 2018 and 2022, according to research from M&amp;G comparing the FTSE All-World index with the FTSE Global Core Infrastructure index. Meanwhile, research from ClearBridge Investments found that during 21 market sell-off episodes identified since 2005, global listed infrastructure stocks outperformed global equities 67 per cent of the time, delivering excess returns above global equities of 2.7 per cent on average.
Other benefits are higher dividend yields, based on inflation-linked revenue streams. The average dividend yield in the Association of Investment Companies’ infrastructure sector is 6.6 per cent, which compares well with returns on equities — the FTSE 100 has an average yield of 3.68 per cent.
Ben Yearsley, director of Shore Financial Planning, says: “I’ve used infrastructure as [a] core holding for well over a decade now. The combination of stable inflation-linked income (in many cases) and defensive characteristics make it a fascinating asset class.”
Why is the income stable? Alex Moore, head of collectives research at Rathbones, says that utilities, in particular regulated utilities, dominate the infrastructure universe, which means earnings tend to be more contractual in nature, returns more controlled by regulators, and often with a degree of inflation linkage.
At times when the stock market is rising strongly, infrastructure’s performance can certainly look dull. But in the long term, the sector can provide not only income but also some capital growth.
A key driver today is the global co-ordinated push towards green climate goals, reducing pollution and protecting natural environments.
In the US, President Biden has triggered a dramatic economic shift with his 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed&nbsp;at encouraging greater use of renewable energy and green technologies via tax credits and subsidies.
Moore says: “The US is the largest geographical area within the global infrastructure universe, so tends to feature heavily in ETFs and actively managed funds. This could provide greater opportunities to invest in companies that are beneficiaries of the act and have the means to generate renewable energy, especially regulated utilities.”
And there are other opportunities. Gordon Smith, head of fund research at Killik, says the infrastructure sector will play a huge role in the digitalisation of industry — one of the most significant developments in the global economy over the coming decades.
“The exponential growth in data traffic is set to accelerate as both 5G enables greater functionality in settings such as manufacturing and increased computing power brings forward the potential of functions such as AI,” he says.
Analysts at Numis point out that a number of high-quality infrastructure investment trusts are trading on discounts to their underlying net asset values, offering opportune entry points. In core infrastructure they recommend International Public Partnerships for its “high-quality cash flows”.
The trust is trading at a discount of 9 per cent versus a premium of well over 10 per cent a year ago. Numis’s renewable energy recommendations include Bluefield Solar Income, which has delivered “the most impressive earnings delivery in all power markets”. It is trading at a discount of 4.3 per cent, versus a 4 per cent premium for much of 2022.
Killik recommends funds targeting different infrastructure areas: 3i Infrastructure, an investment trust investing in unquoted transport and communications infrastructure and utilities. It is trading at a 3.52 per cent discount versus a 24 per cent premium at the start of 2022. Killik’s Smith says it delivers “resilient and predictable operational and financial performance”.
It also recommends Cordiant Digital Infrastructure, an investment trust focused on data centres, mobile telecommunications and broadcast towers, and fibre-optic network assets. It is on a 19.44 per cent discount against a 12 per cent premium at the start of 2022. Smith predicts: “an economic tailwind for many years.”
FTF ClearBridge Global Infrastructure Income invests in global listed infrastructure securities including in gas, electricity and water utilities, and communications. Smith says: “The strategy fits well with our own view of wanting to gain exposure to areas of the market which are beneficiaries of key structural trends (such as the move towards renewables).”
This fund is also the pick of Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at Interactive Investor. He likes “the reliable yield generated from dividends of underlying holdings and capital growth above the level of inflation over five years”, and the “highly regarded and well-resourced infrastructure team”.
Meanwhile, Shore Financial Planning’s Yearsley picks First Sentier Responsible Listed Infrastructure as his “all-round choice suitable for most investors as a core long-term holding”.
But remember, some infrastructure is riskier than others. When constructing a portfolio, Killik distinguishes between social infrastructure (such as hospitals and schools) where often government-backed cash flow is received; regulated assets (such as utilities) paid a return based on the size of the underlying asset base; user pay assets (such as a toll road) where payment is received based on use and therefore there can be variability from the economic environment; and fully competitive unregulated assets subject to supply and demand risk.
Even heavily regulated infrastructure is not immune to risk, especially political&nbsp;risk. Just look at the current debate about the UK water industry. Moore says: “Many companies operate in regulated industries such as water and electricity. This means that their earnings might be set by regulators [and] provides a degree of certainty, but also means their future returns are out of their hands.”
Some areas of infrastructure can also be demand-driven in nature; for example, toll roads and railways. “These areas are not as cyclical compared with consumer-facing companies, but demand can be impacted by macroeconomic factors,” says Moore. “This was seen in extremis during Covid lockdown.”
Experts at Killik also warn that the value of infrastructure assets and the financing structure of infrastructure businesses can (like all yielding assets) be highly sensitive to changes in inflation and interest rate expectations. This is a significant consideration for assets often designed to last 30 or 50 years.
When researching investments, it is important to distinguish between listed and unlisted infrastructure investments. One option is to buy investments in the equity of companies involved in the provision or maintenance of infrastructure. Typically, these are priced daily and tradeable on stock exchanges. For example, the biggest holdings in the iShares Global Infrastructure UCITS ETF (an easy way to hold the big players) are US infrastructure group NextEra Energy and US transport group Union Pacific, with National Grid the only UK firm appearing in the top 10.
The other option is unlisted infrastructure. Traditionally such assets have been the domain of governments but in recent decades a combination of privatisation, public-private partnerships and regulated private investment in infrastructure have opened the sector to financial investors.
Investors are thus not short of options for their portfolio including for tax-efficient self-invested pensions (Sipps) or individual savings accounts (Isas). Most retail investors do not access the sector through direct stakes in companies but via collective investments, where professionals can weed out the duds.
The main choice is between open-ended funds and closed-ended investment trusts. The Investment Association, which represents open-ended funds, launched a dedicated infrastructure sector in September 2021. These 29 funds invest primarily in equity of companies involved in infrastructure and may be diversified by region or have a specific focus.
But if you want to access a mix of listed investments plus direct investments in unlisted projects look to the investment trust sector, where there has been a phenomenal expansion of opportunities over 20 years. Back in 2013, there were just six infrastructure investment trusts, with £4.3bn of assets. Today the total infrastructure sector is worth £34.7bn, spread across three sectors — nine companies in traditional infrastructure, 22 in renewable energy and two infrastructure securities companies investing in listed infrastructure stocks.
Interactive Investor, the investment platform, says the investment trusts Greencoat UK Wind, The Renewables Infrastructure Group, Gore Street Energy and NextEnergy Solar have dominated purchases from its sustainable investment recommended lists in the year to date.
The amount you hold in infrastructure will depend on your timescale and attitude to risk — consult an independent financial adviser if unsure.
The MSCI PIMFA Private Investor Growth index, which reflects a growth-oriented investment strategy, has a 10 per cent allocation to ‘alternatives’, which usually comprise infrastructure alongside private equity. Shore Financial Planning’s Yearsley says: “I’d have between 5 and 10 per cent of a portfolio in infrastructure.”
So, even for investors ready to buy, exposure should be pretty limited. But it is worth having something in this particular pot.
As the Financial Conduct Authority prepares to pay £235mn in redress to investors caught up in the Woodford scandal, will the regulator’s new Long-Term Asset Fund (LTAF) solve the problem of how to hold illiquid assets?
This new style of fund has been created after years of warnings that open-ended funds are not suitable for investing in less liquid assets. The critics say holding such assets contributed to the shutting of fund manager Neil Woodford’s Equity Income Fund in 2019.
Even the IMF has intervened in the argument, warning last year that open-ended funds investing in less liquid assets pose a big risk to global financial stability.
The LTAF is an open-ended fund structure designed to give broader access to illiquid and private assets including infrastructure. After six years of preparation, the first fund launched in February — a Schroders vehicle investing in renewables and other infrastructure related to the energy transition. Aviva follows this month with a real estate offering.
The main objective of the LTAF regime is to encourage UK pension funds to direct more capital towards the UK’s economic recovery and to enable investors, particularly those on defined contribution (DC) pension schemes, to more confidently invest in illiquid assets.
In an open-ended fund, the fund manager will arrange for investors to be paid the value of their holding (the ‘net asset value’) out of the fund’s assets, based on an up to date valuation. Alternatively, in a closed-ended fund, such as an investment trust, the investor redeems by selling to another investor for its market value, which may stand at a discount or premium to its net asset value. Although managers of closed-ended funds must also manage their internal liquidity, they do not normally repay investors out of assets.
LTAFs have a notice period for redemptions of 90 days, which should give managers some wriggle room. However, critics say 90 days is no time at all in a liquidity crisis.
So, whether the LTAF structure will appeal to retail investors remains to be seen. There may be better ways into infrastructure, notably via the tried and tested investment trust. Richard Stone, chief executive of the Association of Investment Companies, says: “They have tried to solve a problem that has already been solved.”
He warns: “We believe selling Long-Term Asset Funds (LTAFs) to retail investors is an accident waiting to happen. Minimum notice periods will not prevent liquidity mismatches, which will be particularly harmful to retail investors.”"
NatWest: mass free share offer could revive UK stock ownership culture,Personal Finance,"David Cameron is still prime minister. George Osborne is chancellor. We are years away from the horrors of the Russia-Ukraine war and the Covid pandemic. Brexit is barely a glint in Eurosceptics’ eyes.
It is 2013 and, five years on from the height of the global financial crisis, the UK government is still struggling to work out how to extricate itself from the giant shareholdings it holds in the country’s biggest banks, following the huge 2008 bailouts.
Thorniest of all is the vast stake in RBS — 84 per cent at its peak — that it received in exchange for its £45.5bn rescue of the Scottish lender, the world’s biggest bank bailout.
Enter Policy Exchange, the Treasury’s favourite think-tank, and a plan — adapted from an earlier idea from Portman Capital and the Liberal Democrats — to distribute the shares to the UK population in one fell swoop.
The distribution would be free to any adult who registered but would rely on a warrant-like structure that would only be worth money to recipients if the share price rose above a floor price; when the instrument was sold that floor value would be passed to the Treasury and any upside retained by the individual.
The idea was considered, but dismissed, as too complicated and potentially value destructive for taxpayers. A decade on, there are good reasons to think again.
The most obvious is necessity. RBS, now rebranded as NatWest, is still 41.5 per cent owned by the Treasury. Since 2013, the stock has on average traded at barely half the average price of the bailout. Eight years after the government began its drip-drip strategy of selling off small amounts of RBS stock to institutional investors, and supporting share buybacks, it has offloaded less than half the stake, and crystallised large losses in the process.
(The Treasury’s interest in NatWest is recorded in the government accounts and the financial assessment of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Based on the bank’s total market capitalisation today of about £25bn, the stake is worth a little over £10bn, though after financing costs the Exchequer is down a net £32bn.)
But the logic of sticking to an original desire to recover the initial investment, or as close to it as possible, is unrealistic — the asset was almost certainly overvalued at the time of the bailout; the bank has been deliberately shrunk over the past decade and a half; and the operating environment for banks like NatWest has never returned to the boom times of the pre-2008 years. So valuations for NatWest’s peers remain permanently reduced.
That said, the bank seems to be in better health than for many years. Despite a challenging economy, it recently reported a 49 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the first quarter of the year, beating forecasts. It is time the government — and those that hold it to account, such as the National Audit Office — accept that the baseline bailout price is no longer a relevant metric and that other value-for-money criteria should be prioritised.
This is all a long way from Cameron’s stated desire a decade ago of selling the stake “as fast as possible” and for a high price. Having failed to do so is politically awkward — for the state to own a bank, even partially, is not a good Tory look.
The selldown to date has been painfully slow: there has been a narrow focus on selling at prices that bear comparison with the bailout valuation and a fear of doing damage to the value of the remaining shareholding if the market is flooded with too much stock too fast.
This means that a mass distribution all at once is the only way to exit the position in the short term. A standard Thatcherite sell-off is one option; lower risk, though more complicated, would be the distribution plan, using a smart structure to minimise price volatility.
A related reason to pursue a mass sell-off strategy is the real, perceived or prospective risk of ongoing political interference in the running of the bank.
Even under a supposedly non-interventionist Tory administration there have been instances, whether in relation to bonus distributions or business strategy. There may be sound reasons to think that some water companies, utilities or rail services — many launched as part of Margaret Thatcher’s 1980s economic reforms — have performed poorly post-privatisation and may be better off in public hands. But the business of banking — inherently risky and commercially minded — is a bad fit for government ownership.
In addition to the logical and political arguments, there would be technical benefits to exiting quickly. The very fact of the Treasury’s ownership of a 41.5 per cent stake is a vicious-circle “overhang”: the market knows it will be sold at some point, flooding supply, so it subdues the value of the stock in the meantime. Distributing via a warrant structure would mitigate this risk because there would be no incentive for an individual to sell until the price rose above the floor.
At the same time, a distribution would trigger another technical benefit for the stock. Large shareholdings such as those owned by governments are typically disregarded by institutional investors’ index weightings. As soon as the government’s NatWest stock became part of the “free float”, it would boost demand dramatically. According to Policy Exchange’s 2013 calculations, index funds would have needed to buy shares equivalent to nearly half of the government’s then stake.
Prime minister Rishi Sunak and chancellor Jeremy Hunt have rightly prioritised steadiness in the wake of the alarming leadership of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. But they also talk frequently about the need for economic dynamism, in particular how the City of London and the UK’s equity culture could be bolstered.
One effect of Thatcher’s 1980s privatisations, which in large part were targeted at customers and staff, was to boost retail shareholder numbers in the UK — from about 3mn to 10mn over the course of the decade, according to the World Trade Organization.
Reliable data on how numbers have evolved since is hard to come by, but it seems generally to have ebbed and flowed in line with economic prosperity. It dipped sharply after the 2008 financial crisis.
More recently it has grown a little again as a new generation of investors have bet on “meme” stocks (though that trend — which echoed the fashion for trading cryptocurrencies — has little to do with backing the fortunes of corporate Britain over the long term). Recent polling from finance group Wesleyan suggests the tally of retail shareholders has stagnated at a little over 7mn.
What better way to achieve the important mission of reviving a tired equity culture than to use a reprivatisation of NatWest as a means to launch a new, improved 2020s version of the Thatcher-era sell-offs and the share-owning democracy they fostered?"
Platinum market expected to hit record deficit this year,Precious metals,"The platinum market is expected to chalk up its largest deficit since records began in the 1970s as supply falters in South Africa and China’s industrial expansion powers ahead.
Global platinum demand is forecast to surge 28 per cent this year to 8.2mn ounces after investors piled in, adding to strong industrial consumption and increasing use of the metal in car catalytic converters in the first quarter, according to the World Platinum Investment Council, an industry body.
At the same time ailing output, exacerbated by stuttering electricity supply in top producer South Africa, has pushed the WPIC to revise its deficit forecast up 77 per cent from three months ago, to 983,000 ounces this year.
“It would be a record deficit in ounces since records going back to the 1970s,” said Edward Sterck, director of research at WPIC. He added that the last time 12 per cent of demand could not be met by new supply and recycling was in 1999.
Platinum prices have rallied by nearly a fifth since their February low, to $1,080 per ounce, and are sitting above their five-year average of $940 per ounce.
The gains have encouraged fund managers to turn to exchange traded funds that track the market and are backed by a physical holding of the metal.
The deficit marks a stark reversal from bumper oversupply for the previous two years when car production was hit by semiconductor shortages.
Platinum is used in catalytic converters that reduce vehicles’ harmful emissions, as well as in glass fibre for wind turbines, electronics and petrochemical plants.
In the near term producers say demand is supported by tightening emissions legislation but, in the longer term, uncertainty hangs over whether emerging demand from the hydrogen economy will outweigh the phasing out of combustion engine vehicles.
The forecast comes as the industry gathers in London for its annual Platinum Week conference. The persistent power supply shortages in South Africa, which accounts for 70 per cent of global supply, are likely to be in focus.
Banking turmoil in the US has spurred investors to seek out precious metals, and a growing awareness of the supply deficits for South African fund managers prompted a pivot from equities to holding platinum-backed ETFs, industry sources said.
WPIC believes that industrial demand in 2023 will be the strongest ever for platinum, despite fears over a global economic slowdown, because of chemical and glass plant expansions in China as well as continuing substitution of platinum for palladium in auto exhausts.
Record-high palladium prices have made auto catalysts, particularly those in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, a target for thieves in recent years and drove automakers to switch over to platinum.
Other forecasters disagree with WPIC’s bullishness. In a separate outlook published on Monday Johnson Matthey, the London-listed catalyst technology group, predicted softer growth in demand — at 20 per cent this year — but still expected a deficit of about 130,000 ounces.
The previous years of abundant supply mean that sufficient stockpiles have been built up at 3.8mn ounces to satisfy demand, but as those draw down prices will probably rise and become more volatile.
However, a seismic shift has taken place in which about 85 per cent of material is held in China, where Sterck says it is “captive”, skyrocketing from less than 5 per cent four years ago.
Of the six platinum group metals, which also include palladium, rhodium and iridium, several analysts argue that platinum’s outlook is the brightest due to its use as a catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysers."
Marex cancels London listing,Private equity,"Broker Marex has pulled its planned listing, raising concerns that investors may be growing more cautious on new companies coming to the stock market.
The London-based broker, controlled by two former Lehman Brothers investment bankers following a private equity buyout in 2010, disclosed its decision late on Tuesday evening.
“Despite broad investor interest from high quality institutions in the Marex business and prospects, the company has decided not to proceed with the IPO at this time due to more challenging IPO market conditions,” it said in a statement.
The company, one of the brokers with rights to trade on the historic trading floor of the London Metal Exchange, had intended to list on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, seeking a valuation of $650m-$800m.
Another private equity-backed float, fuel cell company Elcogen, also pulled its plans to list on London’s junior market on Wednesday. The first quarter had been the strongest start to the year in 15 years on the LSE, as more than £15bn in equity was raised in the three months to March.
Marex, which puts on trades and derivatives hedges for big commodity producers and consumers, has grown aggressively through acquisitions since a private equity buyout just over a decade ago. It was led by JRJ Group, a private equity firm founded by Jeremy Isaacs, the former head of Lehman’s European operations, and Roger Nagioff, the bank’s ex-head of global fixed income.
Brokers had speculated that Marex would come up for sale over the past few years as JRJ sought an exit from its investment. The private equity group indicated it would sell down its 41 per cent indirect economic interest through the listing.
The company made pre-tax profits of $55m in the year to December, up from $46.6m a year earlier, on net revenue of $414.7m. Its purchases under JRJ include Spectron, a commodities broker, for $154m, London’s Tangent Trading and Chicago-based equity derivatives firm XFA.
London-based Marex employs about 1,000 people and is one of nine members of the Ring, the LME’s historic open outcry trading floor that had faced closure until a pushback by users. It has a 16 per cent market share on the LME."
Alphawave: omegawhoops,Professional services,"🙃
Alphawave IP Group plc (LSE: AWE, the “Company“ or “Alphawave Semi“) has published today its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2022. The Company notes the following changes to its&nbsp;FY 2022 preliminary results published on 28 April 2023:
So . . . that’s $7mn lopped off sales. Reported operating profit had been overstated by $7.4mn, meaning the operating margin was 3 percentage points too high. The income tax bill was wrong by around $200k, and nearly $400,000 is added onto R&amp;D expenses because the amortisation period’s gone from five years to four.
Heading into the balance sheet, there’s an $8.2mn reclassification of payables between non-current and current liabilities, another $4.4mn reclassification of payables related to deferred comp from its acquisition of Israeli-based Banias Labs in October 2022, and a comprehensive rejig of tax stuff. The company says by way of explanation:
The revenue adjustment, and associated balance sheet entries, reflect the reversal of 86% of the adjustment to the fair value of the deferred revenue acquired with OpenFive [in September 2022].
Oh, and also:
Alphawave IP Group plc (LSE: AWE, the “Company” or “Alphawave Semi”)&nbsp;today announces that its Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Daniel Aharoni is stepping down with immediate effect.
JPMorgan, which along with Barclays is Alphawave’s house broker having organised the £750mn float in 2021, says:
The new audited revenue is 11.4% ahead of what consensus was expecting when the results were due. The new audited Adj. EBITDA is 19.9% below what the consensus was expecting, with the audited margin of 25.3% below the expected 35.1% margin. The fact that the company had spent more was known at the last report; that the miss was much more is not positive, although the fact that the cash flow did not change in the audit is a positive. . . . [On the balance sheet] all the changes are non-cash so there is no change in the reported cash flow of the company, which we view as a key positive.

So the story goes, in 1871, Mrs. O’Leary’s cow kicked over a lantern. Her barn was enflamed. The fire spread quickly through the wooden buildings of Chicago, and 2,100 acres burned.
In the following years, Chicago rebuilt itself with new rules and an upgraded fire department to limit the risk of flames raging across the city. Those Chicagoans understood this wasn’t just a simple accident of a cow and a lantern. It was about building materials and incentives related to the city’s infrastructure. It was about fire prevention and firefighting equipment. Building codes and fire departments, though they come at a cost and need for updates, have made the community more resilient for 150 years.

At Alphaville we are obviously fairly inured to this — and guilty of doing it ourselves — but even we were taken aback by a speech that just landed in our inbox from the Bank of England.
Here are words that BoE’s director of authorisations, regtech and international supervision, Rebecca Jackson, actually stood up and said out loud today at an Association of Foreign Banks Mansion House Lunch:
Jackson’s speech (which can be read in full here) goes on to make seven additional references to “starship PRA”, concluding thusly:
In conclusion, I hope I have convinced you that starship PRA is navigating a sound course; that we have a strong strategy to explore firms both through quieter times and crisis; that we are committed to promoting a dynamic industry in which we might seek new innovations and firms; and that through RegTech and Transforming Data Collection we can push out the efficient frontier and regulate as no one has before.

Bullish on the ‘burbs,Residential property,"US urban living is still losing its shine, three full years after Covid-19 shut down city centres. But apartment rents haven’t declined — yet.
While the prospect of continued city flight has sent office-property valuations into a freefall, US rents are still up, with an 8.8-per-cent rise from last year, according to the Census Bureau’s inflation data. (The median Manhattan rent rose to a new record in March, via Elliman.)
Now some Wall Street analysts expect more Americans to abandon city-apartment rentals for greener pastures, and either buy or rent elsewhere. Analysts’ logic is backed by a simple argument: as Millennials start families, they should keep following the well-trodden path out of city centres into the suburbs and exurbs, in search of cheaper and more spacious living, along with more accessible childcare.
JPMorgan’s strategy team led by Joyce Chang argued in an April 28 note that those trends will drive younger Americans to buy homes:
We expect an increase in demand from first-time homebuyers as Millennials begin forming households in greater numbers. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median age for first-time homebuyers is 33 years old, and according to the CDC, from 2021-2026, the number of people turning 30 years old will average 4.0bn, 18% higher than the 3.4mn people who turned 30 years old from 1998-2005. US Census Bureau data confirms a rise in home ownership among those aged 18-34, while the percentage of those aged 18-34 living with parents is levelling off. We expect the influx of first-time homebuyers from Millennial household formation to provide a major tailwind to housing demand.
One could make counterarguments to dampen enthusiasm about the ‘Millennials Save The Housing Market’ story, of course.
But most of them just support JPMorgan’s argument that US housing markets will be fairly insulated if (or perhaps when) a recession arrives.
First, interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages are still quite high, as you can see from Freddie Mac’s weekly data, even if they aren’t rising much anymore. The blue line below shows 30-year rates, and the green line shows 15-year:
Second, the housing-supply crunch is still real! From JPMorgan:
The inventory shortage is still a relevant theme with new listings down 22% YOY. Fewer homes are hitting the market, limiting the options for first-time buyers and those looking to upgrade or cash in on equity built up from the rise in property valuations. The pandemic drove a wave of migration to suburbs and localities as homebuyers were attracted to lower costs of living. This effectively pulled forward future supply to meet near-term demand, contributing to tighter housing inventory.
The strategists also point out that the median age of US housing stock has been climbing for decades:
Again, this is not a bad thing for home values. The bank writes:
The worst of the housing downturn may have already occurred as the housing market fell into recession last year as measured across home sales and housing starts. The outlook for the interest sensitive housing sector is tightly related to the policy environment. Overall, existing home sales are down 22% over the past year as mortgage rates increased. However, new home sales in the US beat expectations and jumped 9.6% in March. The March data joins other recent housing indicators in signalling that the stabilisation of mortgage rates is supporting a modest pick-up in housing demand. February housing prices also surprised to the upside, with FHFA and S&amp;P CoreLogic increasing 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.
This brings us to a new analyst call based on city flight. Bank of America analysts argue on Monday that the US housing shortage and high mortgage rates will not only support residential housing, but also support suburban rents.
Fear of a recession has been the biggest concern . . . If demand weakens, we expect (1) suburban outperforms urban and (2) coastal would outperform sunbelt. The rationale: supply.
Demographics suggest we are at or past peak demand for urban apartments.
So they’re bullish on residential REITs that own and operate more suburban properties (at least outside of the Sun Belt, where rents are softening). The bank’s analysts upgraded AvalonBay to “Buy” Monday, because it has 68-per-cent of its exposure in suburban markets.
The analysts are also bullish on UDR because of its larger exposure to suburban markets. Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent/AMH are on their “Buy” list as well, obviously, because those businesses are centred around single-family home rentals.
One thing that’s missing from this picture is the ever-elusive pandemic-baby boom, as birth rates have rebounded slightly from their pandemic-era lows. But while the number of homes with children under 18 remained below levels from 2019, according to the Census Bureau, new household formation brought the total number of US households to a new high in 2022.
So it makes sense to think suburban rentals could be the ticket for younger Americans looking to move outside of major city centres, especially with mortgage rates above 6 per cent and strong shelter inflation. As JPMorgan argued, that should lend support to home prices in an economic downturn.
Or to put it into simple internet-speak: homeowning Boomers stay winning."
HELOCked and loaded,Residential property,"For a couple of years, it seemed like American homeowners forgot their post-GFC caution about “withdrawing equity” from their homes. (This equity withdrawal basically involves borrowing against a portion of a home’s value that someone has already paid down.)
But new consumer-credit data from the New York Fed this week shows that US central bankers have stopped that trend by jacking up interest rates. Plus, as Goldman Sachs highlights in a note this week, Americans weren’t borrowing that aggressively against their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic anyway.
And why would they?
With historically low interest rates and historically high savings early in the pandemic, a majority of US homeowners — albeit a small majority — refinanced to lock in lower rates, the New York Fed found. They constituted around 64 per cent of the refi transactions between 2Q 2020 and 4Q 2021, according to the Liberty Street Economics blog.
The remaining 36 per cent cashed out a significant proportion of their homes’ values. That led to a jump in the total dollar amount of home-equity borrowing, as the New York Fed’s bloggers wrote. But that borrowing remained a small proportion of Americans’ disposable personal income, or dpi, as shown by the red line below:
And then, as we all know too well, US interest rates soared from zero to more than 5 per cent in the span of about 14 months.
Mortgage refinancings froze as broader borrowing costs went up, and US homeowners made net contributions to their homes’ equity rather than withdrawals.
This handy chart from Goldman’s note makes clear the post-GFC trend of cautious home financing by Americans, along with the short reversal in that trend after the pandemic:
There’s pressure coming from the banking side as well, according to Fed surveys.
Banks are imposing tighter standards on the revolving lines of credit that they extend against homes (HELOCs), which are popular for financing renovations and other major home projects. Goldman plots banks’ historical survey responses about HELOC loan demand and standards in the chart below:
And finally — what do you know! — the strains on midsized, regional and small lenders could have an impact on HELOCs as well. Smaller banks have kept a growing share of revolving home-equity loans on their balance sheet. While the totals don’t surpass the larger banks, they have $100bn to large banks’ $155bn:
So what does all of this mean?
First, homeowners’ use of HELOCs will be fairly limited (and possibly unpopular) as long as US interest rates stay high. That could slow demand for construction materials, appliances and man-hours used in renovations.
There are also some silver linings to this, in Goldman’s view. From the note:
Entering 2024, however, we think mortgage equity withdrawal will pick up. Recent data points such as new home sales suggest an inflection point in the housing recession as the housing market remains tight . . . Crucially, homeowner sentiment has improved; the April data point of the Fannie Mae National Housing Survey indicates that respondents now expect positive home price appreciation for the next 12 months, a stark change from prior months . . . While we expect interest rates will remain high, stronger housing market sentiment by year-end could give homeowners confidence to tap into the $9.3 trillion of home equity at their disposal.

Revolut in shareholder battle with SoftBank as UK licence talks stall,Revolut Ltd,"Revolut is locked in a fight with top shareholder SoftBank after regulators told the UK’s biggest private tech company it must simplify its ownership to win a long-delayed banking licence.
The Japanese investor has demanded compensation for giving up its priority class of shares, which the Bank of England has made a condition for granting the crucial licence, according to five people with knowledge of the situation.
Revolut needs the licence to help it expand in the UK, the US, Australia and Singapore. Without it, the payments group cannot lend or benefit from the UK’s deposit insurance scheme.
The escalating clash between Revolut, SoftBank and UK regulators is threatening to turn political as the government fears London losing its status as Europe’s main financial services hub following Brexit.
UK business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has organised a meeting next week with Revolut’s top leadership, including founder Nik Storonsky, amid fears that the company may move its headquarters, two people familiar with the matter said.
Storonsky has voiced frustration at the two-and-a-half year wait for the banking licence, criticising the UK’s “extremely bureaucratic regulator” in an interview. He also took aim at the London Stock Exchange, telling The Times it “is much less liquid so I just don’t see the point” in listing in London.
The application is already complicated by Revolut not receiving a clean bill of health from its auditors for its 2021 accounts.
Auditor BDO in March warned it was unable to fully verify £477mn of revenues recorded for the year 2021, including from foreign exchange and crypto.
The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority subsequently alerted the government it was poised to reject the application, before resuming negotiations with Revolut, the people said. Since March, Revolut lost both its UK banking chief executive and group chief financial officer.
The fintech is now racing to release its 2022 accounts as early as next month, which it hopes will be approved by its auditors after it built new systems to better document exchanges and flows of money around the app, they said.
Revolut is separately rushing to reach an agreement with SoftBank, appealing to the Japanese group’s founder Masa Son to break the deadlock. In July 2021, SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led an $800mn series E fundraising that valued Revolut at $33bn, a valuation boosted by $8bn after a meeting between Son and Storonsky.
The PRA told Revolut it needed to collapse its six classes of shares into one, according to the people familiar with the matter. The structure is a legacy of the start-up’s multiple funding rounds since it was founded in 2015.
But while most of the investors had agreed to swap their shares into common stock, SoftBank had demanded twice the amount of common stock Revolut is offering in exchange for giving up some of the preferential rights linked to its current share class, the people said.
The PRA is also requesting that Revolut expand its group level board and add more technology expertise.
Revolut declined to comment on its application or discussions with shareholders. The PRA and SoftBank also declined to comment.
Revolut has 30mn customers around the world and made more than £850mn of revenue in 2022. About 20 per cent of that was made in the UK from about 6mn customers.
The fintech has been criticised for its hard charging culture resulting in high levels of staff turnover. It was subject of a 2021 probe by the Financial Conduct Authority. Its risk management and compliance systems were reviewed in 2020.

EU urged to crack down on imports of Indian fuels made with Russian oil,Russian business & finance,"The EU should crack down on India reselling Russian oil as refined fuels including diesel into Europe, the bloc’s chief diplomat has said, as western nations move to tighten sanctions on Moscow’s energy sector.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, told the Financial Times that Brussels was aware that Indian refiners were buying large volumes of Russian crude oil before processing it into fuels for sale in Europe, saying for the first time the EU should act to stop it.
“If diesel or gasoline is entering Europe . . . coming from India and being produced with Russian oil, that is certainly a circumvention of sanctions and member states have to take measures,” Borrell said.
India has become one of the biggest buyers of Russian crude oil since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with its refiners earning large margins by buying heavily discounted crude that is now largely barred from the EU, before selling full-priced fuels into Europe.
The trade is legal under EU sanctions but has been criticised by those who want to see harsher sanctions imposed on Russia and argue that it has allowed Moscow to keep earning large revenues from its oil sales — the biggest component in the Kremlin’s budget.
Borrell acknowledged that the G7 price cap — which aims to limit Russian crude oil sales to other countries to $60 a barrel — had helped cut Russia’s oil revenues, and said it was understandable India wanted to take advantage of cheaper crude.
But he suggested he was uncomfortable that much of that oil was now flowing back to Europe in the form of refined fuels.
“That India buys Russian oil, it’s normal. And if, thanks to our limitations on the price of oil, India can buy this oil much cheaper, well the less money Russia gets, the better,” Borrell said.
“But if they use that in order to be a centre where Russian oil is being refined and by-products are being sold to us . . . we have to act.”
Borrell’s comments come ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with India’s foreign minister, S Jaishankar, where he will raise the issue, he said. India’s prime minister Narendra Modi is also likely to come under pressure from G7 leaders at a summit in Japan where tackling sanctions evasion will be a key discussion topic.
A price cap coalition official said they believed that the policy was meeting the twin aims of restricting Russia’s revenue while keeping supplies in the global market, and said they were “confident it could weather any fluctuations in individual jurisdictions’ import policy”.
“Russian oil exports have been remarkably stable since the price cap was implemented despite Russia’s claims they would be cutting production,” the official said.
“We’re confident we’re a very long way from undermining the success of the price cap.”
Targeting refined fuel exports would mark a significant step-change in the west’s sanctions regime, which has tried to balance a desire to curb Moscow’s revenues with the risks of losing too much supply from the global market. Separately, the G7 and EU are willing to ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow has already cut supplies, the FT reported.
But on oil, the US in particular is worried about the potential for prices to rise, harming the world economy and potentially even providing Moscow with higher revenues even if Russian export volumes fall.
Adding to the complexity is the fact that existing sanctions, including those on Iran and Venezuela, have generally accepted that once crude is refined, it is no longer designated as being from the country the crude originated in.
Indian refiners, for example, use crude from multiple different countries including Russia, making identifying the exact origin of a barrel of diesel or gasoline challenging.
A dissuasive effect may be generated, however, even by just talking about potential sanctions. One oil analyst said India or other countries could stop buying Russian crude if they thought the EU market could be cut off as a destination for their refined fuels. Russia is the world’s second-largest crude oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and there are already concerns the global oil market will tighten later this year, boosting prices.
Borrell said that any mechanism to stem the flow of Russian oil would need to be implemented “by the national authorities”, suggesting the EU could target buyers of Indian refined fuels they believe are derived from Russian crude.
“If they sell, it is because someone is buying. And we have to look at who is buying,” he said."
Russian oil exports hit post-invasion high,Russian business & finance,"Russia exported more oil in April than in any month since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, with almost 80 per cent of crude shipments flowing to China and India, according to the International Energy Agency.
Russian oil exports edged up another 50,000 barrels a day in April to a post-invasion high of 8.3mn b/d, far exceeding the 7.7mn b/d and 7.5mn b/d that it averaged in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
The rise in shipments reflects Moscow’s success in finding both new buyers for its oil since Europe blocked imports and new vessels after its access to western shipping was restricted.
Since the west first threatened Russia with sanctions last year, Moscow has worked with a growing number of little-known trading companies and tanker-owners to develop new systems to move its oil.
“Russia seems to have few problems finding willing buyers for its crude and oil products,” the IEA said in a monthly oil report on Tuesday.
The EU is discussing its 11th sanctions package on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine last year. The bloc has sanctioned 1,473 Russian individuals and 207 entities and frozen €21.5bn of Russian assets.
However, those measures have been designed to allow Russian oil to continue flowing to countries outside the EU. The result has been one of the biggest shifts in commodity flows, with Moscow rerouting millions of barrels a day of oil from Europe to Asia over the past 12 months.
Despite shipping more oil than in April 2022, Russia’s monthly oil export revenues were 27 per cent lower than last year, according to IEA estimates, partly because of lower global energy prices.
Russian oil has also been trading at a discount to global benchmarks because of a G7-led price cap on permitted Russian exports of oil and refined petroleum products imposed in December and February respectively.
However, that discount has begun to narrow, the IEA said, as Russia has increased its access to non-western shipping able to operate outside of the price caps. Moscow’s oil export revenues in April were $15bn, up from $13.3bn in March, according to the IEA’s estimates.
In total Russia shipped 5.2mn b/d of crude in April, the most since May 2022, including 2.1mn b/d to China and 2mn b/d to India. Total exports of refined petroleum products were 3mn b/d.
“New refining capacity is driving a continued shift east in forecast crude runs for the remainder of the year, mirroring regional demand strength,” the IEA said.
Imports from Russia had helped meet rising oil demand in China, which hit an all-time high of 16mn b/d in March, the IEA added. “China’s demand recovery continues to surpass expectations,” it said.
In response, the IEA increased its forecast for 2023 global oil demand growth to 2.2mn b/d, adding that China would account for nearly 60 per cent of the increase.
The fall in global oil prices in April and early May, when Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell by nearly $16 a barrel in just two weeks, stood in “stark contrast” to the tighter market expected in the second half of the year, it said."
Sam Bankman-Fried asks US court to dismiss criminal charges over FTX,Sam Bankman-Fried,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has asked a New York judge to dismiss criminal charges brought against him following the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange last year.
In a flurry of filings on Monday night, lawyers of Bankman-Fried put forward a number of defences, arguing that the 31-year-old was impermissibly charged with further crimes following his extradition from the Bahamas in December, that some of the allegedly illegal transactions took place outside of the US and that campaign contributions he made to political parties were legal.
US prosecutors last year accused Bankman-Fried of running a “global scheme” to defraud customers and lenders of FTX and affiliated hedge fund Alameda before their collapse in November, when a multibillion-dollar hole was uncovered in the company’s balance sheet.
Bankman-Fried was initially charged with eight criminal counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws, before prosecutors added five more counts including securities fraud and conspiracy to violate anti-bribery laws by paying $40mn to allegedly influence Chinese officials.
The former entrepreneur’s defence team has argued that the charges are “vague and non-specific” and brought in a “classic rush to judgement . . . less than a month after FTX’s bankruptcy”.
Bankman-Fried had pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. His lawyers said he had moved to the Bahamas because the laws governing cryptocurrencies were clearer there, while in the US, “legal uncertainty and ambiguity were common”.
“In the wake of the ‘crypto winter,’ the government, in hindsight, may dislike or disapprove of business practices of the cryptocurrency industry, FTX, or even Mr Bankman-Fried — but this does not give it license to turn them into federal crimes,” the lawyers’ filings said.
In an attempt to “fight these baseless charges and clear his name”, Bankman-Fried drafted in the help of a British barrister, James Lewis KC, to attest that the extradition treaty between the US and the Bahamas, whose legal system is based on English law, was violated when prosecutors added further charges following his arrival on American soil.
Bankman-Fried’s lawyers also complained that John Ray, a veteran of the Enron restructuring who took over as chief executive of the bankrupt FTX, had “acted as a public mouthpiece for the government by continuing to make disparaging remarks” about the defendant.
Ray testified to Congress in December that he had never “seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organisation”.
The executive had been “effectively deputised” by the government, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers claimed, “as federal agents to review and synthesise the evidence for them”. They accused FTX of waiving attorney-client privileges to provide information to prosecutors, while refusing to do so on topics that might help their client compile his defence.
A spokesperson for Ray and FTX debtors did not respond to a request for comment.
A trial in the criminal case is scheduled for October, though Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have indicated they may ask for a postponement.
Three of Bankman-Fried’s former colleagues — Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh — have already pleaded guilty in connection to charges stemming from the collapse and agreed to co-operate with prosecutors."
Scottish Mortgage defends strategy after shares take beating,Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC,"Baillie Gifford’s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust has urged shareholders to remain “disciplined and patient” as it defended its investment approach after a “painful” year in which its shares have dropped by a third.
The trust’s strategy is to identify high-growth companies, such as vaccine-maker Moderna, semiconductor-maker ASML and Elon Musk’s Tesla, which will transform society. These stocks have sold off over the past year as the US Federal Reserve and other central banks aggressively raised interest rates to fight inflation.
Tom Slater, who co-manages the £11.5bn trust with Lawrence Burns, said in its full-year results on Wednesday that the “accelerating pace of change throughout the economy . . . has not translated into our investment results lately, but we need to remain disciplined and patient”.
Slater, Burns and Fiona McBain, chair of the 114-year-old trust, were communicating to shareholders for the first time since a high-profile boardroom bust-up at Scottish Mortgage two months ago.
Amar Bhidé, an academic and one of its directors, stepped down following a blistering attack on a raft of concerns, including about the trust’s investments in unlisted companies and how the board manages its discount.
Burns defended Scottish Mortgage’s strategy of investing in private companies, which it began over a decade ago in 2012. He said that by doing this it had given its shareholders low-cost access to companies including European battery maker Northvolt and SpaceX, “many of which have no public market equivalent”, and received “a lens into the future” as companies were staying private for longer.
Scottish Mortgage’s five largest private holdings alone account for nearly half of its private company exposure with the 10 largest accounting for nearly two-thirds, said Burns: “The companies that make up the bulk of our private company exposure are consequently neither small nor early-stage.”
The decline in technology stocks over the past year is yet to be fully reflected in the private markets, prompting investor fears that a reckoning in the private sphere is still to come.
Burns defended the trust’s “robust valuations process” for private companies, and said that last year 532 revaluations were made with 84 per cent of the private instruments held revalued five times or more. The result of this was that in aggregate the trust’s private company valuations were written down by 28 per cent, compared with a fall in the Nasdaq of 14 per cent.
Over the course of the financial year, Scottish Mortgage deployed £281mn into private companies. Burns warned that there was “a material change in the funding environment . . . from a period of capital abundance to one of capital scarcity”.
He cautioned that “it is likely that a few of our smaller private company holdings may find themselves casualties of this new environment. Should this happen we expect the impact to represent only a small percentage of the portfolio’s assets.”
Last year, turnover in the portfolio was low. Slater said that the only sale from its top 30 positions was Chinese tech giant Alibaba, which it had bought in 2012 when the company was still private. Alibaba was one of several Chinese holdings that were slashed last year, “driven by concerns about the growth of big online platform companies in China after several regulatory interventions, as well as reflecting disquiet about deteriorating Sino-US relations”, he wrote.
Scottish Mortgage also “substantially reduced” its holding in sequencing machine company Illumina. While the manager “still believes gene-sequencing is a fundamental building-block for advances in healthcare . . . the company’s execution has been disappointing”.&nbsp;
In the past year, the trust bought a new holding in gaming company Roblox, took a position in cloud networking-provider Cloudflare, and added to its holding in Latin American ecommerce and finance company, MercadoLibre.
Against a backdrop of market anxiety around growth and private company investing, last year Scottish Mortgage moved from trading at a discount to net asset value of 0.5 per cent to a discount of 19.6 per cent.
McBain, who is retiring as chair and will be replaced by senior independent director Justin Dowley, acknowledged that “such moves can be discomforting for shareholders”. Last year the trust bought back £283.3mn of shares.
Over the past 10 years, Scottish Mortgage’s net asset value per share has increased by 432 per cent compared with a 181 per cent increase in the FTSE All-World index.
The board of directors is recommending that this year the total dividend be increased by 14.2 per cent to 4.10 pence per share. Slater said that the managers remained excited about the long-term opportunities in areas including renewable energy, mRNA-based medicines and artificial intelligence.
He said: ‘It is by investing in the agents of change and partnering to develop big new opportunities, that exceptional returns for shareholders will be generated.”"
‘Halt button’ hit on drilling in US oil and gas slowdown,Shale Oil & Gas,"Next week Texas auctioneer Kruse Asset Management will put two unused, top-of-the-line drilling rigs under the hammer.
The towering structures designed to bore oil and gas wells are on offer for fire sale prices. Valued at $40mn and $30mn when built in 2019, their respective starting bids will be $12.9mn and $2.3mn.
“There’s no reason for them to be so cheap, but there’s just no demand,” said Dan Kruse, chief executive of the San Antonio-based auctioneer, who has been selling oilfield equipment for four decades.
An oversupply of equipment is a stark sign that drilling in US shale energy regions is levelling off, as producers respond to lower commodity prices and pressure from Wall Street to direct spare cash to shareholders.
After slowly climbing since the depths of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of oil and natural gas rigs at work in the country has declined 6 per cent since the beginning of the year to 731 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company. Almost 2,000 rigs were running in the middle of 2014, when the shale revolution was at a peak. Last week the number of gas-directed rigs dropped by 16, or 10 per cent — the steepest weekly fall since 2016.
“Today’s operators are more discerning than ever before,” said Matt Johnson, chief executive of Primary Vision, an energy data company.
Johnson said producers that received a windfall from last year’s oil and gas rally were watching oil prices before hiring new drilling crews. “The overall economy is still in a state of cautious uncertainty and upstream participants are paying attention.”
At the same time, more private companies that accounted for much of the modest increase in shale drilling activity last year have been acquired by cash-rich public companies, which are under greater scrutiny over returning cash to shareholders.
“They had really been the growth engine,” said Nathan Nemeth, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “Now those privates are being bought and taken out and the trend has been a slowdown in growth.”
Recently, New York-listed Matador Resources snapped up private equity-backed Permian basin driller Advance Energy for $1.6bn, while the public company Ovintiv bought $4.3bn worth of assets from Encap Investments last month.
US crude oil and dry gas production are on track to make annual records this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. But as drilling hits a plateau, growth is decelerating.
US oil output soared by more than 1mn barrels a day each year between 2012 and 2014, with production hitting a peak of 13mn in November 2019. Analysts are scaling back forecasts, with the EIA saying production will rise by just 200,000 b/d over the next 12 months to 12.6mn b/d.
The productivity of wells has improved in recent years as companies sharpened their skills at breaking through shale resources. But it has begun to slide in some once-prolific regions such as the Bakken shale of North Dakota, where new oil production per rig rose from a little over 100 b/d in 2007 to more than 2,700 b/d in 2020, but has since declined to less than 1,700 b/d, according to EIA.
Weakening energy prices have accentuated the pullback in US drilling. US oil prices settled just below $71 on Tuesday, down more than 40 per cent since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent them above $120 last year. Benchmark US gas prices have fallen about two-thirds over the same period to a little over $2 per million British thermal units.
Publicly traded gas-focused producers including Chesapeake Energy and Comstock Resources — alongside a host of private companies — have indicated they will ease drilling in the Haynesville shale basin that straddles Texas and Louisiana this year.
“In terms of the gas markets, obviously, we have hit an air pocket here,” Anthony Petrello, chief executive of drilling contractor Nabors Industries, said on a recent earnings call. “When the end of March came along, a lot of those guys just hit the halt button.”
Like its competitors, Nabors has sought to move rigs from gas-focused basins to oil-focused plays such as the prolific Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico. Rival Precision Drilling said on a recent call with analysts that it plans to shift rigs north of the border to Canada.
Many gas drillers are banking on the construction of new terminals to export liquefied natural gas, a promising sales outlet for domestic US gas producers. But these projects take years to come on line and no new projects are scheduled to start up until late 2024.
For Kruse, the auctioneer, that is too late. He said he is now looking beyond the “mushy” US market, seeking buyers based in Latin America and the Middle East.
“We’re marketing everywhere, but abroad is more realistic to find the buyer, I think — where more end users would be. Internationally is probably where the rigs will sell.”"
Record buyback spree attracts shareholder complaints,Share buybacks,"Record levels of share buybacks are attracting complaints from a growing number of prominent investors concerned that the practice is boosting executive bonuses but providing only limited benefits to shareholders.
The world’s 1,200 biggest public companies collectively bought back a record $1.3tn of their own shares last year, triple the level of a decade ago and almost as much as they paid out to shareholders in dividends, according to research by asset manager Janus Henderson. By contrast, total dividends have grown by just 54 per cent in the past 10 years.
The trend has continued this year, with new share purchases announced by companies including HSBC, Apple, Airbnb and caterer Compass. Oil was the sector with the largest amount of share buybacks last year, according to Janus Henderson; companies repurchased $135bn of their stock — four times as much as 2021.
Buybacks are a way for companies to return excess cash to shareholders, and can boost their share price, but the scale of the activity is increasingly attracting the interest of regulators.
US President Joe Biden introduced a 1 per cent tax on Wall Street buybacks that came into force in January; he has recently proposed to quadruple it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a rule that will require publicly traded companies to disclose more information on their buybacks, such as the number purchased and average price paid.
“We would prefer buybacks to be less prevalent,” said Euan Munro, chief executive of Newton Investment Management.
“Used badly, [buybacks] can be used to manipulate [earnings per share] numbers upwards to meet medium-term management incentive targets at the expense of investments that might be important to a company’s long- term health,” he said.
Daniel Peris, a fund manager at Pittsburgh-based Federated Hermes, called buybacks an “environmental hazard”.
“The dividend is just the dividend: grandma benefits, the long-term holder [benefits]. Buybacks benefit traders, hedge funds, senior executives [and] near-term share prices.”
Leigh Himsworth, a UK equity fund manager at Fidelity, said: “As a shareholder you feel like you never actually get the reward” with buybacks. “If the market is nonplussed by it then, as a shareholder, you are worse than square one, as the company has typically used up their cash.”
Abrie Pretorius, a manager at Ninety One, said: “Buybacks only create value for remaining shareholders and strong relative performance when shares are cheap and there are no better uses of that cash which would generate higher returns. Most buybacks help optical [earnings per share] growth but destroy value.”
Buybacks also do not always translate into better share price performance. An Invesco fund that tracks the price of companies that do large buybacks has underperformed the US market over the past decade.
Share repurchases have traditionally been more common in the US stock market than in the UK or Europe, but they are on the rise worldwide. Between 2012 and 2022, repurchases by the biggest UK-listed companies more than tripled from $22bn to $70bn. US-listed companies increased buybacks from $333bn to $932bn, while in Europe share purchases more than doubled to $148bn.
“The approach we have seen in the US to generally prefer buybacks could be problematic if it takes root in the UK,” said Michael Stiasny, M&amp;G’s head of UK equities. “The likely outcome would be that the market ends up yielding permanently less than it could.”
Nevertheless, some investors prefer buybacks to dividends, for instance because they may pay lower tax than on a dividend and can control the timing of when the tax is due.
“I don’t know how we’ve gotten to this point politically, but the idea that buybacks are a bad thing, or simply a way to manipulate your stock, I don’t think could be further from the truth,” said Jim Tierney, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein who focuses on growth stocks.
Lindsell Train co-founder Nick&nbsp;Train&nbsp;said that the benefit of buybacks depended on the purchase price, but they could be “a wonderful way for a board to build enhanced wealth for long-term shareholders”.
Bernard Ahkong, co-chief investment officer at UBS Asset Management’s hedge fund unit O’Connor, said: “We don’t want companies to boost dividends in an unsustainable fashion only to then have to cut them say one year later — and there would be less negative fallout from doing a one-off buyback, for example.”
On Friday, the US Chamber of Commerce sued the SEC in an effort to block its plan to require more buyback disclosure. “Stock buybacks play an important role in the functioning of healthy and efficient capital markets,” said Neil Bradley, the chamber’s vice-president and chief policy officer.
Some analysts expect the flurry of activity to taper off. Goldman Sachs forecasts that spending on buybacks by US S&amp;P 500 companies will this year drop 15 per cent to $808bn and dividends will rise 5 per cent to $628bn as weak earnings growth constrains the total payout to investors, although next year it expects buybacks to rise again.
David Kostin, Goldman’s chief US equity strategist, said: “The slowdown in US earnings growth, the increase in policy uncertainty following the recent banking stress, and high starting valuations at which to repurchase stock all pose headwinds to buybacks.”
Sharp declines in US companies’ cash holdings have limited their ability to pursue buybacks, while rising interest rates have removed the incentive to fund them with debt, he said, adding that Biden’s buyback tax was unlikely to have a notable effect.

Share buybacks need less hate and more scrutiny,Share buybacks,"Share buybacks, once an American oddity, are taking over the world. Company repurchases of their own stock hit a global record last year of $1.3tn, triple the level of 10 years ago, according to research by Janus Henderson. While US companies remain the biggest buyers, the transactions have gained favour rapidly in continental Europe and the UK since the start of the pandemic.
But more is needed than the unbridled endorsement of activist investors or the reflexive opposition of progressive critics. Instead, we should welcome new efforts to give buybacks the considered scrutiny they have long needed.
Historically, companies with leftover cash returned it to their shareholders as dividends. But in recent years, more and more of them, particularly in growth sectors such as technology, have opted instead to buy back shares, sometimes even taking out debt to do so.
Some investors, particularly those with short-term horizons or those who worry about spendthrift empire building, like that way of doing things. They would rather see the instant stock price boost that a buyback provides by reducing the overall share count. Taxes on capital gains are often lower than on dividends and the recipient controls the timing because the levy only has to be paid when the shares are sold.
Executives in cyclical industries also like that share repurchases are seen as occasional, rather than expected, benefits. That means they can be more easily halted in bad times than dividends, where a cut is seen as a major admission of weakness. Last year, share buybacks accounted for almost half the cash global companies returned to shareholders, up from one-third in 2012, the Janus figures show.
But there are strong reasons to be sceptical. Consider the Invesco exchange traded fund that invests in companies that have bought back 5 per cent or more of their stock in the previous year. If buybacks really juiced performance, it would be a winner. Instead it has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year and over the past 10 years, although it did better during the first part of the pandemic.
Critics contend that companies are so addicted to the instant share price kick that they mortgage their futures by underpaying staff or cutting back on research to pay for buybacks. And we should think about who really benefits when companies that pay their staff in newly issued stock then repurchase shares to counteract the dilution they have just created. That is why US president Joe Biden included a new 1 per cent tax on buybacks in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act. Now he wants to quadruple it.
I don’t share the hate. It’s much better for companies to return cash than engage in headline-grabbing acquisitions that ultimately destroy value, or throw away money on pet projects such as Facebook’s enormous bet on the metaverse. Climate activists should cheer the recent growth of buybacks from oil and gas companies. That sector not only has a history of overpaying for investment, but its shareholders can reinvest the money directly into green energy.
But buybacks are no substitute for thoughtful investment in growth — and decent pay for staff. And they can be abused. When staff at the US Securities and Exchange Commission looked at stock buybacks in 2018, they found that insider selling shot up right after the announcements, allowing executives to profit personally from the share price pop. Such selling is probably not illegal, then commissioner Robert Jackson observed, but it smacks of self-dealing.
This month, the SEC finally did something about this issue by creating a new rule that will require companies to disclose at the end of each quarter their daily repurchases of stock, why they did it and whether executives bought or sold shares right around the buyback.
The US Chamber of Commerce promptly sued, calling the rule an affront to free speech and an attempt to micromanage corporate decisions. The group contends that most of the increased insider selling around buybacks is driven by a few outlier companies so it is unfair to impose the disclosure burdens on everyone.
The reverse is more likely to be true. Both insider sales and total buybacks already have to be reported, so companies should be able to compile quarterly data. And the new disclosures will make instantly clear which corporate executives — if any — are taking advantage of buybacks to feather their own nests.
More of such sunshine around buyback programmes would reduce the heated arguments they generate by helping investors differentiate between the good and the bad.

Goldman’s SVB client-or-counterparty conundrum,Silicon Valley Bank,"Craig Coben is a former global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America and now a managing director at Seda Experts, an expert witness firm specialising in financial services.
Just over two months ago Silicon Valley Bank embarked on a plan to save itself from a potentially fatal ratings downgrade.
The rescue plan involved two sequential steps. First, SVB would sell its portfolio of bonds at a loss to Goldman Sachs. Second, SVB would replenish its losses by launching a stock offering to be managed by Goldman.
Alas the second leg failed, catastrophically, triggering a bank run from depositors and the eventual collapse of the bank.
In prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee on Monday, former CEO Greg Becker makes clear he was following external advice (our emphasis):
On March 8, SVB announced that it was selling the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portion of its securities portfolio with the intention of reinvesting at higher rates, and that it was raising additional capital. Based on the advice of Goldman Sachs, we decided to sell our AFS portfolio first in order to realize those losses and explain to the market why we were raising capital, given that SVB’s financials were otherwise healthy… SVB’s executive team, the Board, and our outside advisors intended for these actions to reinforce SVB’s capital position … The consensus was these actions were in SVB’s best interest.
According to Becker’s account, Goldman had proposed a holistic solution: first sell the bonds to Goldman, then sell stock to the market. Goldman reportedly netted a windfall trading gain on the bond deal, but the equity offering (which was not guaranteed or underwritten) foundered as depositors panicked, precipitating a vicious loss-of-confidence cycle that ended in the demise of the bank.
Becker’s testimony, however, appears to contradict what Goldman wrote in the 10-Q it filed on May 4 (our emphasis):
The firm is also cooperating with and providing information to various governmental bodies in connection with their investigations and inquiries into SVBFG and its affiliates (collectively “SVB”), including the firm’s business with SVB in or around March 2023, when SVB engaged the firm to assist with a proposed capital raise and SVB sold the firm a portfolio of securities.
This formulation (which — confusingly — reverses the chronological sequence of events) seems to suggest that Goldman didn’t propose a holistic solution. In this telling, Goldman traders and investment bankers happened to be working with/for SVB at the same time, but there was a Chinese wall between them.
One side of the firm presumably didn’t know what the other was doing, although Goldman senior management was likely aware. For the bond sale, SVB was a market counterparty to Goldman; for the stock offering, it was Goldman’s client. Update: In a statement to FTAV, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson reiterated that:
Goldman Sachs assisted SVB with a proposed capital raise and later purchased a portfolio of securities from them. Prior to that sale, Goldman Sachs informed SVB in writing that we would not act as their advisor on the sale, and that SVB should not rely on any advice from the bank in this regard but instead hire a third-party financial advisor.
The difference in the two narratives matters. Goldman owes a duty of care to a client, but not to a counterparty.
Noting that several US senators were demanding an investigation into Goldman’s role, I wrote in FTAV last March:
If Goldman had an actual advisory relationship (in the form of a signed mandate or an informal understanding), it raises the stakes considerably as to its responsibilities, because the outcome — bought deal for the bonds, best efforts for the equity — served its own interests more than SVB’s. Any investigation will presumably scrutinise the advice Goldman gave on the rescue package. And the fact remains that Goldman has reportedly made a lot of money from a package that failed to rescue SVB.
Becker says that, on the advice of Goldman, he sold the bonds first as part of a comprehensive rescue plan. Goldman will probably argue that it bought the bonds on an arm’s-length basis and — in a totally unrelated undertaking — tried its hardest to place the equity.
There is a lot riding on which version of events prevails."
Stonks: Thank you AI hype,Societe Generale,"Alphaville has already highlighted how much AI mania has contributed to the US equity market’s 2023 gains. SocGen is now arguing that even those estimates underplay the impact.
The French bank’s analysts find that without the gains of stocks that are possible AI winners, the S&amp;P 500 would now be down 2 per cent this year, rather than up 8 per cent.
It’s not immediately clear from the note how SocGen classifies “AI Boom stocks”, but we’re guessing it includes the likes of Nvidia, Microsoft, SalesForce, and Alphabet. Here’s SocGen’s Manish Kabra, with our emphasis:
The AI boom and hype is strong. So strong that without the AI-popular stocks, S&amp;P 500 would be down 2% this year. Not +8%.
Our update on the AI sentiment news indicator keeps rising exponentially and more extended than when we first talked about few weeks ago.
While AI as a theme has been with us for a while and we suggested being long SG Robotics and AI Equity as a secular theme last year, it is tough to fight against a very strong hype on a very short-term.

Audit matters at THG,THG PLC,"Always a fan of browsing the key matters sections of auditors’ reports, page 163 of last month’s THG annual accounts caught our eye (emphasis ours):
In regards to the revenue from THG Ingenuity, the risk we have identified is split across both product revenues and other revenues (services, hosting) reported by THG.
As a result, we identified a potential risk of bias or fraud through management manipulation by manual adjustments, especially in the last quarter of the financial year. We have identified a potential risk of bias or fraud through management inappropriately classifying revenue to THG Ingenuity. We have also identified a risk of inappropriate recognition of THG Ingenuity contract revenue by manipulating the performance obligations against which revenue is recognised.
Once known as The Hut Group, THG is a controversial British tech-ish conglomerate that has not met the expectations of its much celebrated flotation at a £5.4bn valuation in 2020.
THG’s market capitalisation at pixel was sub-£800mn, following the recent announcement that it won’t sell itself to private equity group Apollo. Excitement about the potential bid may be why the auditor’s report went largely unread and unremarked.
The key matters section of such reports has been essential reading ever since PwC highlighted “commercial income” as a risk at Tesco in 2014, warning readers that the amount of revenue recognised from promotions, discounts and rebates from suppliers was “material” and “judgemental”.
PwC said then:
We focused on this area because of the judgement required in accounting for the commercial income deals and the risk of manipulation of these balances.
We mention Tesco and its subsequent accounting scandal purely as reason why investors pay attention to such things as a general matter, to be clear.
The key matter at THG highlights the group’s restructuring of reporting lines last year. THG Ingenuity is one of THG’s three divisions, the “operational infrastructure and digital hub” which supports the other two — Beauty and Nutrition — as well as being a “third party e-commerce solution” targeting what the annual report describes as a £277bn addressable market.
Following the restructuring, the annual report explains that “revenue is now recharged for the services that THG Ingenuity provides to the wider group.” As it happens, one of the services is “fraud management and detection”. See this graphic on page 33:
An operation that is both an ecommerce supplier to other retailers and a significant cost centre no doubt requires excellent management and internal controls to keep everything straight.
Helpfully, THG provides investors with a split of Ingenuity’s £160mn revenue, and its much larger £597mn of “internal revenue” that is eliminated on consolidation.
Investors can also rest easy in the knowledge that EY, having identified the risk of bias or fraud, took the following procedures:
We performed a walkthrough of each significant class of revenue transactions within THG Ingenuity or ‘Other revenue’ and assessed the design effectiveness of key controls.
For a sample of new contracts, we reviewed the terms of business and management’s assessment of how IFRS 15 is applied to the contract terms, including the identification of performance obligations and allocation of consideration to each performance obligation identified. We assessed the status of the project and whether the relevant site had ‘gone live.’ Where these projects were yet to go live, we understood the reasons and considered whether revenue had been recognised in line with IFRS 15. Our assessment included, but was not limited to:
- Variable consideration- Services which have been rendered at nil charge- Principal vs agent considerations- Consideration of whether any contracts contain embedded leases (IFRS 16).
For a sample of existing contracts, we enquired of the customer managers as to whether there had been changes in the contract terms, including changes in performance obligations and allocation of consideration to each performance obligation identified.
We tested a sample of other revenue transactions, agreeing the amounts to invoice, proof of service or cash receipt. For the items selected we tested that the correct amount of deferred revenue has been recognised at year-end. For these items we also tested the classification of the revenue by segment.
We challenged management on the classification of revenue as ‘Infrastructure’ and ‘Commerce’ revenue and ensured that different elements of THG Ingenuity are clearly articulated given external interest in this business.
We tested manual revenue journals at in-scope locations, understanding the reasons for the transactions and corroborating to appropriate evidence.
We tested these journals throughout the year, with increased focus on those booked in the last quarter of the year where we consider there to be a heightened risk of manipulation. We also selected a sample of transactions at random to build in an element of unpredictability to our testing.”
In its key observations communicated to the audit committee, EY identified “a reclassification for discounts amounting to £17mn” that was corrected by management, said it did not identify any other material misstatements in the revenue, and was “satisfied that the disclosures appropriately describe the classification of revenue and are also in compliance with IFRS 15.”
The firm’s opinion on the accounts was unqualified.

LinkedIn has a fake commenter problem,Technology sector,"William Grace-Hunter doesn’t exist, though this may not be immediately obvious from his LinkedIn profile. The “senior investment consultant at BlackRock” is a highly opinionated reply guy, albeit with only one interest and one post to his name:
“There is no such thing as an investment consultant at BlackRock” said a spokesperson&nbsp;for the asset manager, who added that had the person been a real employee commenting on an individual stock or issuer on social media it would have been a disciplinary matter.
LinkedIn has been facing a growing tide of disinformation. The social media network blocked more than 58mn accounts between July and December 2022, up from 22mn in the first six months of the year, according to its most recent transparency report:
And while systems exist to spot profile cloning and spam accounts, artificial intelligence has made identification more difficult. A study by the Stanford Internet Observatory in 2022 identified more than 1,000 active profiles using what appear to be faces created by AI.
“Fake profiles have an adverse effect on the trustworthiness of the network as a whole, and can represent significant costs in time and effort in building a connection based on fake information,” write Shalinda Adikari and Kaushik Dutta of Cornell University in a 2020 paper.
Their research suggests that by targeting recently created profiles with no avatar, narrow engagement and limited biographical information, fakes could be weeded out with a very high accuracy. It’s not a strategy LinkedIn currently applies, so prominence may be given to profiles such as the ones shown below:
To be clear, behind each of these profiles may be real people with sincerely held opinions. For anyone who feels their viewpoint is being ignored, all kinds of social media can seem to provide a megaphone.
It is LinkedIn’s status as a corporate safe space — which Microsoft has worked to defend following its 2016 purchase of the site — that makes these low-quality posters an existential concern. The platform consistently ranks near the top for phishing attempts, according to cyber security company Check Point Research, while NordLayer finds that more than half of US-based businesses report having been targeted by scammers via the site.
LinkedIn said last year it was strengthening systems to keep “inauthentic profiles and activity” off the platform, including making public when accounts had been created and whether the user had verified their phone number and work email.
But having turned 20 this year, the proliferation of fake profiles is only one of LinkedIn’s problems to solve. Low quality content and narrow engagement can manifest on even the most verified of accounts:
LinkedIn and THG, the subject of Grace-Hunter’s only post to date, did not respond immediately to our requests to comment.
Update 5.50pm BST:
Grace-Hunter is no more. A LinkedIn spokesperson said: “We use technology and teams of experts to help keep our community safe and trustworthy. 99 per cent percent of detected spam and scams were removed by our automated defenses and 99.6 per cent of detected fake accounts were blocked before members reported them. When we receive reports of fake accounts we quickly take action, as we did in this case.”"
The untold story of the world’s most resilient currency,Thailand,"The writer is chair of Rockefeller International
In February of 1998, 25 years ago this month, I was in Bangkok, ground zero of the Asian financial crisis. The implosion of the Thai baht had triggered a serial meltdown of currencies and markets with protesters in the streets across the region and chaos spreading. As world leaders raced to slow the global contagion, Thailand and its neighbours had sunk into a depression.
The Thai economy contracted by nearly 20 per cent, as stocks fell by more than 60 per cent and the baht lost more than half its value against the dollar. Prices in Bangkok felt unbelievably cheap. I did not dare buy Thai stocks, with so much unsettled. But I did leave with many shopping bags and two golf sets, one to give away.
While the drama of that year is etched in history, the epilogue comes as a surprise. Since early 1998, Thailand has faded on the global radar but the baht has proved uncommonly resilient, holding its value against the dollar better than any other emerging world currency and better than all but the Swiss Franc in the developed world.
In contrast, in Indonesia, where the 1998 crisis toppled the dictator Suharto, the rupiah trades near 15,500 to the dollar, down from 2,400 before the crisis. The baht trades at 33 to the dollar, not much lower than 26 before the crisis.
Yet Thailand hardly feels expensive: a foreign visitor can find a 5-star hotel room for under $200 a night, a fine dinner in Phuket for $30. Despite the strong baht, Thailand is globally competitive. The epicentre of the crisis became an anchor of stability, and a lesson to other emerging economies.
After 1998, many emerging societies turned financially conservative, especially those hardest hit in south-east Asia. Indonesian banks went from opaque dens of cronyism to models of good management. The Philippines and Malaysia moved to rein in deficits. But nowhere in the region did a government turn more economically orthodox than in Thailand, avoiding the excesses that can scare off outsiders and tank currencies.
South-east Asia was in recovery by 2000. Since then, Thailand’s government deficit has averaged 1 per cent of gross domestic product, less than half the average for emerging economies. Its central bank has been similarly cautious, keeping rates relatively high and broad money supply growing at 7 per cent a year, third lowest among major emerging economies.
The ultimate pay-off for orthodoxy is low inflation. Thai inflation has averaged just over 2 per cent, the same as the US, a rare feat for an emerging country. Among other emerging economies, only China, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia have had lower inflation than Thailand since 1998.
Before the crisis, Thailand pegged the baht to the dollar, which allowed it to borrow heavily abroad, and run up huge current account deficits. As foreigners lost confidence in Thailand, the government was forced to drop the peg and allow the baht to float freely. Its crash followed, but the baht would go on to recover its losses and become one of the least volatile currencies.
Steady foreign income helped. Thailand remains among the most open emerging economies. Trade has risen from 80 per cent of GDP in 1998 to more than 110 per cent today. The external deficits that foretold the crash gave way to surpluses, as Thailand built on its strengths in tourism and manufacturing, which generates a quarter of GDP.
During the crisis I drove on a new four-lane highway out of Bangkok to see the factories rising on the green pagoda-dotted hills of the eastern seaboard. This manufacturing base in paradise continues to evolve, lately for example from cars into electric vehicle parts, and to draw heavy foreign investment.
Meanwhile the tourist hotspots around Phuket and Koh Samui expand alongside new forays into medical and wellness services. Since the crisis, tourism has more than doubled as a share of GDP to 12 per cent, becoming an unusually large source of foreign exchange. Most countries with tourist sectors that big are tiny islands.
Thailand also has its flaws, including heavier household debts and a more rapidly ageing population than most of its peers. Despite that, its per capita income has more than doubled to nearly $8,000, up from $3,000 before the crisis.
Moreover, Thailand has achieved financial stability despite constant political upheaval, including four new constitutions in the last 25 years. By overcoming challenges the Swiss franc never faced, the Thai baht has sealed its unlikely claim to be the world’s most resilient currency — and a case study in the upsides of economic orthodoxy."
Investors should brace for US debt ceiling turbulence,The Long View,"Are mainstream investors ready for disaster? With the clock ticking close to a US government debt default described by Treasury secretary Janet Yellen as an “unthinkable” move with “dreadful consequences”, we could be about to find out.
For specialist hedge fund managers who make money only in the event of calamities such as financial crises and pandemics, bracing for the worst is pretty easy: just keep picking up options and other instruments on the cheap that provide a hedge against sudden price falls. Then when the nightmare scenario strikes, count your billions and slap on your best suit to go on Bloomberg TV and say you take no pleasure in everyone else’s pain.
More typical fund managers who cannot afford to make money just once a decade have a trickier task.
On the face of it, they are ready for the small chance that the market underpinning every asset value on earth is about to backfire. Prices for US credit default swaps — derivatives that provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of debt — have picked up markedly albeit with only tiny volumes changing hands compared with the vast size of the market. That means some investors, most likely hedge funds and especially those that thrive on disaster, have placed low-cost, high-reward bets on a market meltdown. But even this market is not looking panicky, as such.
Meanwhile, a glance at the US stock market would not suggest anything is amiss. The benchmark US equities index the S&amp;P 500 has been going nowhere since the end of March. You can make the case it should be higher, given the continuing slowdown in inflation, so maybe the debt ceiling cliff edge is holding it back. Maybe.
Still, this is not a market that looks like it could be just three weeks or so away from a government debt default. It is a serious possibility, though; Unless Congress raises or somehow redefines the US debt limit sharpish, the federal government will find itself unable to make a range of payments including to holders of its debt, potentially as soon as early June.
It is hard to overstate how much of a problem this would be for markets. If Treasuries fail, then stocks, bonds and everything in between will convulse in violent ways that are hard to predict. The desperate dash for cash in March 2020 and the UK gilts crisis of 2022 are just two reminders of how sudden market shocks can turn ugly, quickly.
The relative calm now stems from several sources. One is that analysts and investors broadly believe cool heads will prevail. Congress will do a deal or find some kind of fudge or gimmick to avert a horror show, just as it did the last time this issue really flared up in 2011 and just as it has done 78 times since 1960. Fund managers feel like they have seen this movie before and it always ends OK.
This time it is dangerous to assume politicians will find a compromise. As political analyst Tina Fordham points out, a tendency towards calm, sensible problem-solving is not exactly a prized asset for Congressional members these days. She thinks there is a roughly 20 per cent chance of a US debt default in the coming weeks. “Twenty per cent probability events happen all the time,” she said on CNBC this week.
The other reason this is not yet really hurting stocks is that, just as it is not possible to be a little bit pregnant, “it is hard to price in a little bit of default”, say rates analysts Richard McGuire and Lyn Graham-Taylor at Rabobank. “Hence, CDS and short-dated Treasury bills are reflective of heightened hedging demand while equities . . . appear somewhat insulated as the game of brinkmanship is played out.”
Rabobank’s analysts are with the crowd on this: “Our base case is that a default will be avoided.” Even so, they point to the other big danger, which is that for the politicians involved, the chaos itself is an important part of the process.
“It is in the interests of both parties to appear willing to countenance [a default] for as long as possible, as this maximises the likelihood of extracting concessions should the other side blink first,” they said. “[That] does raise a clear risk that the market’s apparent broader sanguinity on this front will be tested in the coming weeks.”
This is a view shared by Sushil Wadhwani, chief investment officer at PGIM Wadhwani. In a note this week, he said that “in an increasingly polarised environment, politicians will need to see significant market turbulence in order to reach an agreement”.
Investors are conditioned to believe that in the event of some kind of downturn in markets, stocks will quickly push back up. As Wadhwani pointed out, that is unhelpful. “There is a concern that the market is being complacent and that investors could be in for a sudden shock,” he said. “Investors would not want to see unexpected fiscal tightening at a time when the risks of US recession are already rising and the possibility of a hard landing is increasing.”
If you are trundling along assuming this will all work out just fine, you’re possibly in the same camp as Donald Trump, who thinks “it could be really bad, it could be maybe nothing, maybe it’s a bad week, or a bad day, who knows?” That may help focus the mind.

The asset class du jour: corporate bonds,The Long View,"Debt market specialists have been banging the drum on this for months: bonds are back.
Now it appears this message has cut through sufficiently clearly — particularly on corporate bonds — that the popularity of the bet is one of the few things they think could hold the asset class back, at least in the short term.
Financial markets had a pretty awful run in 2022, of course, both in equities and debt. Corporate bonds in the US lost about 14 per cent over the course of the year, according to data compiled by ICE and Bank of America, and that is the safe, generally even (whisper it) boring investment-grade paper — not the risky high-yield stuff often impolitely referred to as “junk”.
But the grim performance in price has jacked up yields to some of the highest levels investors have seen in two decades. Euro-denominated corporate bonds entered 2022 yielding about 0.5 per cent. Now investors can get more like 4 per cent. That’s still less than inflation, sure, but it’s a serious improvement, and it means buyers are getting as much return now for safe, steady investment-grade debt as they were a few months ago on racier, more default-prone high-yield paper.
“Mid single-digit returns in fixed income? That’s good enough,” says Tatjana Greil Castro, co-head of public markets at credit investment house Muzinich &amp; Co, who turned more positive on this asset class in September last year. “If you want high single digits or if you’re lucky, double digits, you go into equity markets.” As a result, she no longer feels the need to stray into shakier companies, or in to longer-term debt with greater sensitivity to benchmark interest rates, to grab decent yields.
“Taking very modest risk already makes the end client happy,” she says. “Investors don’t say ‘go and shoot the lights out’. They want steady returns.”
Specialists are suddenly finding themselves in demand. The much higher yields now available have “got people talking again”, says James Vokins, who runs the investment-grade team at Aviva Investors. “‘Sweet spot’ is the right word for now,” he says, with new clients looking to shelter from the madness of equities or take on some credit exposure without the white-knuckle ride of more default prone high-yield debt.
No sweet spot lasts forever, of course. One reason for caution is simply that everyone suddenly seems to love corporate debt. The supply of new bonds on to the market is strong enough to mop that up for now, but portfolio managers say they are a little nervous that it could start becoming a crowded bet.
Vokins at Aviva also warns that investment-grade debt is priced for perfection, not for any hiccups, which could come in the form of further wind-downs in bond-buying programmes and other liquidity measures from central banks later this year, or from what is expected to be very large volumes of government debt issuance in the coming months.&nbsp;
“We are quite hastily moving towards pricing in a lot of good news,” he says. “When you manage a large portfolio you have to be ready for that next move — we need to be very mindful of that and approach markets slightly more cautiously as we move through the year.”
Still, some big shifts in asset allocation look set to provide long-term support. “It really does come down to the fact that over many years there’s been a broad-based reallocation away from public markets towards private markets and equities by institutional investors because public fixed income markets simply weren’t yielding enough,” says Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for Franklin Templeton Fixed Income. This has left many of those big investors with exposures to the asset class that are low by historical standards.
Now, she says, buyers of investment grade can expect to earn a yield of about 5 per cent, and the big shift back into this type of debt has further to run. “I think that’s the story,” she says. “In a sense it’s going to be a bit of a rocky ride, this reallocation, but it has to happen.”
Another allure for Greil Castro at Muzinich, aside from signs of steady improvement in the eurozone economy, is that even if she buys debt at 90 cents on the euro, say, she is pretty confident she will be paid back the full 100 cents when the debt matures, barring a truly catastrophic recession. Corporate balance sheets are in good shape thanks to all the cheap borrowing they did in the immediate aftermath of the Covid outbreak.&nbsp;
So if you stick with relatively short-term debt, “your relationship with the market becomes less and less important”, says Greil Castro. “After all the turmoil I think a little bit of respite is quite appreciated.”
That makes this feel like a snug place to be. “If you have volatility but you start with a [yield] close to zero then clearly you feel it, a lot,” says Greil Castro. “If you were to run out naked in the cold you will feel it but if you go out with a warm winter coat then you can sustain it much better. Now we have a warm winter coat and boots on for bad weather so we’re well prepared.”

Proxy adviser backs activists’ climate resolution at Total,TotalEnergies,"Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended that investors in TotalEnergies back a shareholder resolution urging the group to do more to cut its emissions, as activists try to pressure the French oil major to roll back some gas projects.
Dutch shareholder activist Follow This, along with 17 investors making up about 1.4 per cent of Total’s capital, is calling on the oil and gas group to cut its emissions more aggressively by 2030 in a resolution to be voted on at a shareholder meeting on May 26.
In particular, the resolution urges Total to be more aggressive on its Scope 3 targets, which cover the carbon produced when a product sold by the company is burned. The investors say the pathway set out by Total cannot be aligned with the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement — or the goal of keeping global warming well below 2C above pre-industrial levels — in part because the company plans to continue new oil projects for now.
In an ISS recommendation seen by the Financial Times, the proxy adviser said investors should vote for the resolution. The motion is not binding, but ISS’s advisory could give it further momentum.
“The proposed shareholder resolution has some merits as it is identified there is some missing information to provide comfort the Scope 3 goals are taking this trajectory of the Paris agreement,” ISS said in its note.
Significant shareholder dissent is generally regarded as being a vote against a management recommendation by at least 20 per cent of the shares voted.
Total said the resolution did not “provide a credible response to the challenges of climate change and would be contrary to the interests of the company, its shareholders and its customers”.
ISS did not return requests for further comment. The proxy group has occasionally backed such motions in the oil and gas industry before, although only in the US and in Norway in recent years.

It supported a successful drive by hedge fund Engine No. 1 to install three board directors at ExxonMobil in 2021 in a push to make it improve its carbon footprint.
Follow This called the ISS recommendation on Total “a breakthrough” and said it marked welcome support for its drive, which it hoped would be expanded to its campaigns at other oil majors. It is making a similar push at Shell, BP, Chevron and Exxon.
“These supermajors will only change if shareholders massively vote for change,” said Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This.
However, the chances of the resolution gaining anywhere near majority support are slim. Total has urged investors to vote against the motion, which was also brought by investors including Edmond de Rothschild, Mandarine Gestion and Sycomore Asset Management.
Total has been increasingly investing in renewable energy assets, dedicating $5bn of its investment budget this year to spending on such projects compared with $4bn previously.
But investors such as Sycomore have said this is not enough, and urged the group to curtail new oil and gas projects.
Total has forecast that its Scope 3 emissions will stand at less than 400mn tonnes of CO₂ equivalent by 2030, but it already achieved that last year with a figure of 389mn tonnes.
Total last year blocked a climate resolution from Follow This and it was never put to a vote. Total put forward its own climate motion, which was rejected by 11 per cent of investors. In 2021 a resolution led by asset manager Meeschaert urging Total to do more on emissions was backed by 17 per cent of investors."
Lee Olesky to step down as Tradeweb chief,Tradeweb LLC,"Lee Olesky is to step down as chief executive of Tradeweb Markets after more than a decade leading the bond trading venue he co-founded that went from a start-up to a $20bn giant of the fixed income markets.
The US group said on Wednesday that Olesky, who launched Tradeweb in 1996, would move aside as chief executive at the end of the year. He will also replace Martin Brand, a partner at private equity group Blackstone, as chair immediately. Billy Hult, president of Tradeweb and a close associate of Olesky will replace him as chief.
Under his direction Tradeweb has become one of the most influential actors in the fixed-income market as more deals have shifted from being negotiated over the phone to being executed electronically. Tradeweb was one of the first venues to use the internet as the backbone for its operations.
As of January, brokers and fund managers were trading more than $1.1tn a day of bond, mortgage and derivatives deals on its electronic markets as investors position themselves for rising interest rates and inflation. It has also been one of the best-performing listings worth more than $1bn in the past three years, climbing 130 per cent and outperforming the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which has risen 55 per cent, according to data from FactSet.
Olesky told the Financial Times it had been “a hard decision” to step down. “It’s been a big part of my life for 25 years,” he said. “I wanted to finish strongly and the company to be in a great position. We’re coming out of the turbulence of the last few years. There is an element of a cycle ending and it is a new time.”
Olesky, a former banker at Credit Suisse, launched Tradeweb as a rival to the investment banks that dominated credit trading on Wall Street. He left in 1999 to start BrokerTec, a rival US Treasuries trading venue, but returned only months before BrokerTec was bought by ICAP, the interdealer broker run by British entrepreneur Michael Spencer, in 2002.
He became chief of Tradeweb in September 2008, a week before Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Hult, who joined Tradeweb in 2000, became president. Hult has been the driving force behind many of Tradeweb’s most successful US businesses, including the mortgage and Treasury franchises.
“I can preserve the very strong culture of this company and add my own stamp on it,” said Hult.
He added that London Stock Exchange Group, which has a 52 per cent economic interest in the platform through its ownership of Refinitiv, had been “very supportive”.
Brand, one of the driving forces behind LSE Group’s $27bn purchase of Refinitiv and an LSE board member, will leave as chair of Tradeweb after three years."
"Erdoğan’s ‘unsustainable’ policy risks lira sell-off, warn rating agencies",Turkish economy,"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s strong showing in Sunday’s election has prompted rating agencies to warn of a fresh sell-off in the lira if the Turkish president continues his “unsustainable” economic policies.
Turkish assets have sustained a blow after Erdoğan beat his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in the first round vote, heightening his chances of prevailing in a May 28 run-off. The cost to insure Turkey’s debt against default has jumped over the past two days, with the “spread” on five-year credit default swaps rising to 646 basis points from 506bps on Friday.
The selling in Turkish assets came as investors reversed bets that Kılıçdaroğlu, who led in pre-election polls, would bring Turkey back to a conventional economic policy, undoing a patchwork of programmes that have been put in place under Erdoğan’s leadership.
Concerns are mounting of more pain to come if Erdoğan secures a new mandate and presses on with a number of unorthodox policies, including his insistence on maintaining low interest rates to cure inflation running at more than 40 per cent.
“Another term for President Erdoğan would likely imply a continuation of the current unorthodox and unsustainable policies and macroprudential measures with a heightened risk of persistent very high inflation and severe currency pressures,” said Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating agency.
Erdogan’s government has deployed a range of unconventional measures to stabilise Turkey’s $900bn economy, including tight controls of companies’ transfers of foreign currency and the 2021 launch of special savings accounts to protect depositors from lira fluctuations.
These tools have helped slow the lira’s fall, although the currency is still trading near a record low at TL19.67 to the dollar.
But many analysts say the lira remains overvalued, in part due to these measures and a prolonged effort by the central bank to prop up the currency. The lira has fallen about 60 per cent against the dollar over the past two years.
Turkey’s large current account deficit, which hit a record $24bn in the first quarter of this year, was also a “big issue”, said Erich Arispe, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, another of the leading credit rating agencies.
Arispe said Turkey would need to “find . . . billions of dollars” to finance the yawning deficit, something that may be achieved in part by continuing to tap into its dwindling stock of foreign currency reserves.
Net foreign assets, a proxy for the size of Turkey’s foreign currency war chest, have declined to minus $13bn from $1.4bn a year ago, according to central bank data collated by the Financial Times. Those figures include billions of dollars in funds borrowed from the domestic banking system through short-term lending tools known as “swaps”.
Arispe said that pressure on international reserves had been “significant in recent weeks” as the government took a pro-growth approach ahead of Sunday’s elections.
HSBC also indicated on Monday that Turkey’s current account deficit was one of its main “vulnerabilities”. The bank said April trade data suggested there was “no sign an improvement is under way in the near-term”.
“Such a sizeable deficit, mostly financed via [a drawdown in reserves] is unsustainable and should be reflected via a weaker lira,” HSBC said in a note to clients. The bank said it expected the lira to tumble to 24 to the dollar by year-end, marking a 18 per cent decline from current levels. However, it said it also cannot rule out a deeper slide to 27.
Barclays analyst Ercan Erguzel added that he expected the current account deficit to hit about $40bn in the next 12 months. Turkey would need about $30bn to finance it when excluding funds coming from unknown sources, known as “errors and omissions”.
“Turkey may use its gold reserves ($15bn) and get additional help from friendly countries ($15bn). However, it looks a very delicate balance to us,” Erguzel said."
Turkey’s foreign currency and gold reserves fell $17bn before election,Turkish economy,"Turkey’s foreign currency and gold reserves tumbled $17bn in the six weeks before Sunday’s general election as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government sought to prop up the economy and lira ahead of the tightly contested polls.
The central bank’s foreign currency war chest dropped by $9.5bn from the end of March to May 12, while its gold holdings fell $7.9bn, according to Financial Times calculations based on official data. Both figures represented a decline of 15 per cent.
The declines come as investors and analysts are becoming increasingly concerned about the unconventional economic programmes the Erdoğan government has used to stabilise the economy. Those fears have only been exacerbated since Erdoğan’s strong showing in Sunday’s first-round vote put him in pole position for another five years as president.
The soaring demand for gold, meanwhile, was driven local buyers seeking a safe asset to protect their savings at a time of acute inflation and a lira that is trading near record lows.
“There’s a growing demand for dollars and gold in the market,” said Enver Erkan, chief economist at Istanbul-based brokerage Dinamik Yatırım Menkul Değerler. “The central bank is doing whatever it can, but that’s not a sustainable approach, because there’s not much left in the tank, in terms of reserves.”
The general election was seen as a potential economic turning point for Turkey, with Erdoğan’s main challenger Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu promising a series of economic reforms.
However, Erdoğan’s unexpectedly strong first round — he failed to secure an outright majority but scored a much bigger share of the vote than his rival — has heaped pressure on the lira and knocked other Turkish assets ahead of the May 28 runoff vote.
Foreign currency reserves registered $53.2bn as of May 12, two days before Sunday’s election, but those figures include tens of billions of dollars borrowed from domestic banks through short-term agreements known as “swaps”. Reserves had been $75bn at the end of 2022. Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management described the fall in reserves as “huge”.
Fitch Ratings told the Financial Times this week that pressure on foreign currency reserves increased as the government took a strongly pro-growth approach before the elections, and because these assets are helping to finance Turkey’s near-record current account deficit. Economists also say the central bank has used reserves for years to slow the currency’s fall.
Turkish authorities have made it more difficult for local consumers and businesses to purchase foreign currencies, as part of Erdoğan’s attempt to prop up the lira and reduce the use of the dollar and euros across the $900bn economy.
Many are turning to gold as a way to protect their savings, against a lira that has fallen 60 per cent against the dollar over the past two years to a record low, and persistently high inflation that has diminished the currency’s purchasing power at home.
Turkey suspended gold imports after the earthquake since imports to meet retail investor demand were driving up its current account deficit. The central bank has been drawing down on its reserves to supply the domestic market.
Record levels of gold purchases by central banks around the world were the driving force behind the metal’s rally since November, with prices rising from $1,615 per troy ounce to about $2,000.
Turkey’s central bank was the largest reported purchaser of bullion in the official sector last year, growing its holdings by 148 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council, an industry-funded group.
However, the bank abruptly turned seller in March, with outflows of 15 tonnes of gold followed by a further 81 tonnes in April, the WGC said, amid a surge in demand in Turkey for bars and coins. The value of Turkey’s gold reserves was $44.3bn on May 12, central bank data shows."
Turkish default protection costs soar as Erdoğan leads presidential vote,Turkish economy,"The cost of buying insurance against default on Turkish bonds has shot up to its highest level since November as investors brace themselves for further market stress on signs that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appeared on course to clinch the country’s presidential election.
The “spread” on five-year credit default swaps jumped more than 100 basis points to 607bp on Monday morning, the biggest single-day movement since March 2021. That means it would cost slightly more than $6mn a year to insure $100mn of debt against default for five years.
But investors cautioned of bigger swings to come. “So far everyone is in wait-and-see mode, no one really knows how the market will react,” said Cagri Kutman, Turkish markets specialist at KNG Securities.
“If Erdoğan stays in power, most likely we will see CDS trade at 750bp or more” he added.
Leading up to the vote, Turkish markets had rallied as Erdoğan’s main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was ahead in the polls and had vowed to undertake sweeping reforms to lure back foreign capital.
But as Turkish markets opened on Monday Erdoğan was well ahead, and is now viewed as the clear favourite, with the two main candidates likely to be sent to a second round of voting on May 28.
Yields on Turkey’s benchmark 10-year dollar-denominated bonds, meanwhile, jumped to 9.25 per cent on Monday, a sharp 0.97 percentage point increase from Friday, to the highest level since March. Yields rise when prices fall.
Movements in the currency were more muted after Turkish state banks sold dollars to support it ahead of the election results. The lira was down 0.2 per cent against the dollar to TL19.66.
Timothy Ash, of BlueBay Asset Management, a veteran Turkey watcher, said the government would fight to hold the lira steady until the second round but would struggle to do so for much longer.
“The battlefield will be the lira,” he said. If Erdoğan won the second round, he said, “we will be back to the perennial balance of payments crisis and we know the story there — Erdoğan doesn’t want to raise interest rates, Turkey has a big demand for dollars and they don’t have a lot of reserves”.
Turkey’s large current account deficit and shortage of reserves leave importers struggling to obtain dollars. Citizens trying to buy foreign currency as protection against depreciation and inflation add to downward pressure on the lira.
Ash said that if Kılıçdaroğlu had won the presidency, the lira would still have fallen to about TL25 against the dollar owing to unmet demand. With an Erdoğan victory, he expected it to fall quickly to between TL25 and TL30 to the dollar after the second round.
Assuming the government continues to prop up the lira post-election, the Central Bank of Turkey may be forced to raise rates in the second half of the year to avert a “major deposit dollarisation”, said analysts at UBS.
Turkey’s Bist 100 stock index — which ended 2022 at a record high but has since fallen 15 per cent — initially dropped 6.4 per cent before recovering to trade 3.1 per cent lower by midday local time. Financials were the worst-performing stocks, with the sector declining 8.3 per cent.
Real estate and construction groups shot higher: Kiler Holding rose by a tenth while Pasifik GYO and Kizilbuk GYO added 9.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively.
Kutman said the recent rally in stocks, like demand for dollars, had been driven by local investors seeking protection against inflation and that this would limit the downside. Investors would now be looking for signs of a change in economic policy from the next Erdoğan administration but, as the president gave no indication of this during the election campaign, the likelihood of any shift towards economic orthodoxy was small.
“Clearly the keyword now is uncertainty,” Kutman said. “There are big question marks over what may come next.”"
UK awards first round of carbon storage licences,UK energy,"The UK has awarded its first round of carbon dioxide storage licences as the country seeks to take a global lead in the growing technology.
Spirit Energy, owned by British Gas’s parent company Centrica, is among 12 companies offered 20 licences to stash carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gasfields off the British coast.
Sites include areas near Aberdeen, Teesside, Liverpool, Lancashire and Lincolnshire.
The awards mark a step forward for efforts to develop an industry to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from factories and others struggling to abandon fossil fuels.
Several companies have used carbon capture and storage to extract oil from depleting fields but using the technology to reduce emissions is still at a very early stage.
There are currently no active carbon storage sites in the UK, but the government wants about 30mn tonnes, about 9 per cent of current emissions, to be stored each year by 2030.
The strong appetite for the licences — 19 companies applied — reflects the growing commercial case for the technology given a fivefold surge in the price UK polluters have to pay for carbon dioxide emissions over the past five years.
Developers also hope to eventually store carbon dioxide imported from polluters in continental Europe and elsewhere, making best use of the UK’s waning oil and gasfields.
Lord Martin Callanan, minister for energy efficiency and green finance, said Britain was in “prime position” to “grow our economy by becoming world-leaders in this developing industry”.
Stuart Payne, chief executive of the North Sea Transition Authority, the industry regulator, said it was an “important day”.&nbsp;
“As a nation, we cannot meet our decarbonisation targets without carbon storage. This is net zero delivery in action,” he said.
The industry remains at a very early stage, however, and there is no certainty the storage sites will be built.
Developers awarded the 20 licences can now physically appraise sites, but they will need other permits and leases before they can start commercial storage.
The government has pledged £20bn to support the industry over the next 20 years but has yet to finalise details. But developers are still waiting on the exact shape of that aid before pushing the button on investment. They estimate that large sites will each cost billions of pounds to set up and run.
Many of those offered licences are oil and gas producers looking to repurpose depleted fields.
Neptune Energy, a private company chaired by Sam Laidlaw, and the London-listed EnQuest confirmed they were among the winners.
However, the environment has changed for oil and gas producers since the licensing round opened in June 2022.
The government increased the tax rate on oil and gas producers for a second time as of January, meaning it now stands at 75 per cent. Meanwhile, gas prices have fallen from the record highs hit last year.
“The windfall tax is having an impact,” said David Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, which represents oil and gas producers.
“It is basically taking away the capacity of organisations to invest.”
Regulators did not release a list of the companies offered licences, as there are still conditions to work through before awards are confirmed.
Spirit Energy, which Centrica owns with Germany’s Stadtwerke München, confirmed it had won a licence as part of its plans to repurpose its gasfields in Morecambe Bay in north-west England to store carbon dioxide.
Chris O’Shea, chair of Spirit Energy and Centrica chief executive, said the project could create “thousands of jobs in the north of England”.&nbsp;
He said Centrica was “ready to invest over £1bn”, depending on the extent of government support for the industry.
While some carbon storage licences have been awarded ad hoc in the UK and Norway in recent years, Thursday’s announcement is the first carbon storage licensing round in Europe."
Rise of ‘shadow credit’ as consumers turn to risky loans,UK financial regulation,"Bank bosses in the UK have warned that growing numbers of consumers are relying on “shadow credit” during the cost of living crisis by taking out risky loans from the murkier corners of the financial system.
“I do think there’s a worry out there that people are moving more and more into unregulated credit,” David Lindberg, chief executive of Natwest’s retail bank, told the Financial Times.
“What you’d find is if you look 15 to 20 years ago, credit-related stress is housed in the banking system. Today it sits in ‘buy now, pay later’, in utility bills and collections from government agencies and in many cases from less regulated, high interest rate credit providers or ‘friends’,” he added.
Despite rising interest rates and double-digit inflation, high street banks such as HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Barclays have shown little sign of stress in their loan books. “Arrears — or overdue payments — at the big banks are still low historically,” said Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital.
But even as analysts cheer the resilience of big banks’ balance sheets, some bankers have warned that the unregulated shadow lending sector might mean the financial system is less stable than it appears.
Nigel Terrington, chief executive of Paragon Bank, said: “Shadow banks tend to play on the risky edge of credit markets as they exploit regulatory differences. With [regulatory] requirements about to get tougher on banks, this situation will only get worse.”
Greenwood added: “Banks have been de-risked since the financial crisis and that risk has been pushed into shadow banking. It’s where all the bodies are buried.”
Riskier types of credit are becoming prevalent as the cost of living crisis pushes people into more expensive forms of short-term debt.
Research from the Centre for Social Justice, a UK think-tank, has estimated that more than 1mn people borrowed from illegal money lenders in 2022, compared with 310,000 in 2010.
Non-bank finance amounted to $239tn globally in 2021, according to the Financial Stability Board, an international body of major economies. Shadow banking now represents nearly half of the world’s total assets. The FSB said in the UK, based on a narrower measure of non-bank finance, shadow banking had reached $1.7tn, up from $900bn in 2008.
Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at investment manager Netwealth, said people should generally be “wary” of finance in the shadows. “We need to differentiate between areas of shadow banking that cause financial instability and those that provide funding to parts of the market that need it, where banks are not filling the space,” he added.
The Bank of England said last month that it was monitoring shadow banking, conducting a “system-wide stress exercise” of non-banks as well as traditional lenders “to help us to map out the risks”.
Andrew Bailey, governor of the BoE, said “issues” around shadow banking “bear a striking resemblance to ages-old challenges in finance, such as leverage, and interconnectivity with other parts of the financial system, creating the scope for spillovers and systemic consequences”.
Buy now, pay later — a popular form of short-term credit that has faced criticism over the affordability of its loans — is due to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Under government plans unveiled in February, the watchdog would gain powers including banning companies from lending if they fail to complete adequate credit checks.

Ineos warns UK is taxing North Sea ‘to death’,UK tax,"Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has accused the British government of taxing the North Sea oil and gas industry “to death” and warned that plans to spend up to £1bn upgrading key pipelines were at risk.
Ratcliffe, one of the UK’s richest men, accused the government of playing “primitive politics” when it introduced a windfall tax last year on North Sea producers, raising the tax rate from 40 per cent to 75 per cent, which he said threatened all future investment in the sector.
“Taxes are now so high that profits no longer fund future investments,” he said in a statement to the Financial Times, adding: “What the country needs is energy security, which means encouraging developments in our strategic energy reserves in the North Sea. There has been no thought given to the long-term consequences of this ‘tax it to death’ move.”
The government raised the tax rate on North Sea oil and gas producers last year to drum up cash as it spent billions shielding consumers from record gas prices and the related cost of living crisis following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Since then, a number of companies have blamed the windfall tax for cutting back on investment. In March, Linda Cook, chief executive of Harbour Energy, the North Sea’s largest producer, said the levy had “all but wiped out profits” and said it would force her to shift investment away from the UK.
Ineos said the levy raised doubts about its plans to upgrade a key part of the UK’s energy infrastructure — the Forties Pipeline System — a network that carries almost one-third of the UK’s offshore oil and gas production.
David Bucknall, chief executive of Ineos’s energy division, told the FT that a “large chunk” of the £1bn has been invested since it bought the pipeline network from BP in 2017.
However, he warned that the full investment was in doubt unless the North Sea remained viable. “I think if the declines [in oil and gas production] continue as they are, then the business case won’t be there to make further investment.”
As well as operating the Forties network, Ineos has oil and gasfields in the North Sea and owns the Grangemouth refinery as well as a petrochemical site in Scotland.
Ratcliffe, who is a leading contender to take over Manchester United football club, said the “big winners” from higher UK taxes were companies in the US, where Ineos recently completed a $1.3bn deal to buy oil and gasfields.
Bucknall said Ineos would welcome a “price floor” on the windfall tax, a policy that is being discussed inside government and would scrap the levy should oil and gas prices fall below a certain level. He called on the government to develop a “balanced energy policy that recognises security of supply and affordability and a pace of transition that matches our ability to deliver it”.
In a statement, the government said the windfall tax would “fund £26bn in cost of living support from excess profits while encouraging investment in order to bolster the UK’s energy security”.
“We have been clear that we want to encourage reinvestment of the sector’s profits to support the economy, jobs, and our energy security, which is why the more investment a firm makes into the UK, the less tax they will pay,” it added.
Bucknall also hit out at plans by the opposition Labour party to cut the investment allowances built into the windfall tax. Labour, which is leading in the opinion polls ahead of an expected general election next year, declined to comment."
Why equity research fails over and over (and isn’t coming back),US & Canadian companies,"Rupak Ghose is an adviser to fintech companies and a former financials research analyst.
When I joined Credit Suisse First Boston in the summer of 1999 I knew where the action was — equity research. Yes, really.
There was legendary telecoms analyst Jack Grubman at Salomon and Internet analysts Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley and Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch, each feted by the media and taking home tens of millions of dollars a year. They were the market gods, not the traders or the buyside. I was therefore thrilled to become a media equity research analyst at CSFB.
As the dotcom bubble was raging, the cowboys at CSFB went big on tech by hiring Frank Quattrone and his merry band. It was seen as a home run to hire such a huge revenue generator. CSFB gave Quattrone the autonomy he craved — including having the stock research analysts report into him.
Then things changed.
Two decades on from the Eliot Spitzer settlement that shook up the investment research business, there are four reasons why it is still shrivelling in size and credibility: declining information advantage, new competitors, margin pressure in secondary cash equities and a shrinking client base.
Let’s start with a declining information advantage. In the movie Wall Street, the corporate raider Gordon Gekko says: “Come on, tell me something&nbsp;I don’t know. It’s my birthday, pal, surprise me.”&nbsp;Bud Fox replies with insider information about a lawsuit at the airline where his father works. The RegFD disclosure requirements in 2000 started a push to prevent selective information dissemination by companies, and compliance on the sellside has been tightened significantly since then.
Management teams are more careful what they say, and access to them is more limited than back then. The declining influence of the sellside means the days of CFOs chasing analysts for their time are long gone. This creates an awkward competition between analysts to get into the good books of the companies they cover with softball questions and statements on conference calls like “Great quarter, guys!”
Downgrade a stock to ‘sell’ and the investment bankers may not be able to get you fired (at least not immediately), but you are likely to lose management access. That gets you to the same final destination of the dole queue, albeit more slowly than in the past.
That’s because these days a large part of the value proposition of analysts is taking groups of investors on roadshows to visit private and public companies, or access to their contact base of experts. But companies have been expanding their investor relations teams to take over management roadshows themselves, and in age of unbundled research, why spend a fortune on sellside research when you can just tap one of many expert networks?
However, technology, not regulation, is what has flattened the world of research. Sellside analysts — constantly being monitored by an army in compliance departments — are surprisingly poor at wading through the online noise to extract relevant signals on their stocks.
With so much information from companies, expert analysis and media content circulating free on social media, the bar that sellside content must clear to charge is much higher. The proliferation of blogs from both amateurs and experienced former sellside and buyside strategists at much lower price points is another deflationary drag on research spending.
As for the sellside’s continuous lack of negative ratings, dedicated short selling research firms such as Muddy Waters and Hindenburg have jumped into the breach. Some media outlets that are trying to protect their moats have expanded significantly in investigative journalism (an FT subscription to read Dan McCrum’s Wirecard reporting was far cheaper and valuable than the research reports the sellside produced).
Third is the evaporating profitability of sellside cash equities businesses. Most revenues and profits are generated by equity derivatives and prime brokerage. Cash equity commission rates have collapsed in equity trading, and market share ceded to high-frequency trading firms. Algos don’t need to speak to equity research analysts.
Fourth (and intertwined with all the above factors) is the increasingly small client base for sellside equity research.
Only a decade ago, large asset managers like Fidelity would be at the top of research client lists, generating huge amounts of revenues through trading commissions explicitly tied to research content. But the number of large, long-only asset managers that consume and pay for sellside content has collapsed, making analysts increasingly dependent on a small number of multi-strategy hedge funds.
The irony of all these developments is that equity research analysts now work more for investment banking than ever before. Although payments are now indirect and spread over many parts of the bank, the proportion of a cash equity sales and research department cost base that is covered by commissions from the buyside is lower than ever before.
And whatever happens on the regulatory front, it’s hard to see how anything will meaningfully change. The era of star analysts died years ago, and isn’t coming back."
A debt ceiling debacle might actually be good for Treasuries,US Treasury bonds,"Almost every day, there is a new warning of how the US not raising the debt ceiling will cause a cataclysmic debt default that will reverberate through global financial markets.
“The default would cause interest rates to skyrocket,” says the CEA. It would unleash an “economic and financial catastrophe” according to Janet Yellen. “It would have very significant, hard to predict, and likely lasting effects on investors, issuers, and markets alike,” argues Gary Gensler.
Last week the former and current chairs of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (a club of banks and investment groups that advises the government on its debt issuance) warned that “any delay in making an interest or principal payment by Treasury would be an event of seismic proportions”:
The role of the Treasury market as backbone of the entire financial system cannot be overstated. As evidenced in March-2020, Treasury market dysfunction will rapidly propagate into other markets, harming American consumers, businesses, and municipalities alike. Trading in and financing of U.S. Treasury securities would be called into question, leaving the market without a benchmark pricing curve and causing investors to pull back from fixed income and equity markets. Market intermediaries would reduce liquidity provision amidst increasing volatility, heightened operational risks, and concerns about credit worthiness and collateral eligibility. The validity of Treasuries as eligible collateral for margin would be called into question, with devastating consequences for interest rate derivative, commodity, and mortgage markets.
Basically, dogs and cats living together.
However, things aren’t quite that simple, especially when finance and politics collide. As weird as it sounds, you could see Treasuries end up rallying if the US really does run out of money and the debt ceiling isn’t increased.
Basically, all the above warnings are probably true, which is why the US government will never ever default.
As Barclays’ Ajay Rajadhyaksha (and a former TBAC member) wrote in Alphaville earlier this year, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have already made clear from previous ceiling stand-offs that debt servicing would be prioritised. The Republicans have given the Democrats political cover to do so by proposing a bill that would even compel them to do so.
The White House has kicked up some dust around this and loudly talked about the terrible dangers of a debt default to put pressure on the Republicans. Yellen, for example, has argued that “prioritisation is effectively a default by just another name”.
Except it really really isn’t.
Since 1976 there have been 22 US government shutdowns because of US government budget appropriations shortfalls, 10 of which led to unpaid furloughs for non-essential federal workers. As incredibly stupid as they were (and annoying/terrible for people directly affected) no one was saying that was even remotely akin to an actual US Treasury default.
So, while there could conceivably be an accident if the Treasury doesn’t keep enough tax income in reserve to cover all bonds and bills as they come due, the smart money is on the US government avoiding a debt default even after “x-date”.
The White House will just slash all other spending — Medicare cheques, military salaries etc — and force the Republicans to wear the political fallout.
HOWEVER, this would obviously lead to an economic calamity. Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner of the Brookings Institution estimate that the immediate spending cuts would be incredibly painful.
If the debt limit binds, and Treasury were to make interest payments, then other outlays will have to be cut in an average month by&nbsp;about 25 percent. That would be necessary because the Congressional Budget Office expects close to 25 cents of every dollar of non-interest outlays to be financed by borrowing in 2023. If Treasury were to prioritize interest payments as well as Social Security payments, as some commentators have suggested they could, other payments to people, businesses, and agencies would see even more substantial cuts of roughly one third.
Ajay argued the economic cost probably wouldn’t be felt immediately, because most people who would suddenly miss a cheque would still feel confident that it will arrive soonish anyway. Perhaps. But a lot of federal workers probably don’t have a lot of savings to draw down while they wait for their paychecks.
Given the backdrop of already-tightening credit conditions, the result would be an almost certain, immediate and severe economic recession, which would deteriorate dramatically for every day the government spigots run dry.
Now, that would obviously be bad for financial markets in general, but Treasuries themselves are likely to rally.
Firstly, a US recession will help subdue inflation further and could spur the Fed into reversing some of its rate increases, and the safety of Treasuries is pretty attractive when stocks are puking. Secondly, the safety of Treasuries will actually have been burnished by the whole debacle, with the US government showing it would rather renege on payments to sick grannies and disabled soldiers than bondholders. That’s a pretty powerful signal.
Therefore the final result of crossing X-date without a debt ceiling deal could be similar to what we saw after S&amp;P downgraded the US credit rating in 2011: a perverse but powerful Treasury rally. Markets move in mysterious ways."
Trading conditions in $22tn Treasury market worsen ahead of Jackson Hole,US Treasury bonds,"Trading conditions in the $22tn US government bond market, a bedrock of the global financial system, have deteriorated as traders brace themselves for a key speech this week from Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell.
Liquidity, or the ease with which traders can buy and sell bonds, has worsened as a series of jerky price movements and uncertainty over Fed policy have kept investors from making big bets. Thin trading volumes, with many market participants out of the office in August, have exacerbated the problem.&nbsp;
The Treasury market is the biggest, deepest and most important bond market in the world and acts as a benchmark that is used for pricing trillions of dollars of assets globally.
Policymakers and investors have been scrutinising trading conditions following the market turmoil in March 2020 in which abrupt falls in liquidity contributed to the acute volatility in Treasuries. A severe sell-off earlier this year highlighted how difficulties have persisted even as markets more broadly have steadied.
The recent drop in liquidity comes as Powell is set to deliver a speech at the Jackson Hole summit this week, typically one of the biggest events on the year’s economic calendar. Reduced liquidity matters because it can lead to big price swings.
“Liquidity is lousy,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. And it could “absolutely cause potential problems next week if Powell has something big to say”.&nbsp;
Bid-ask spreads for the benchmark 10-year note and the 30-year bond in early August hit 5½-month highs. The spreads are now slightly off those levels but remain elevated and have been widening again in the past week. Since the Treasury market is so actively traded, this gap, which tracks the difference in the price buyers are willing to pay and the price at which sellers are offering, is typically narrow.
Guneet Dhingra, head of US interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley, said bid-ask spreads had been widening for two reasons: “The first is that this is the month of August and volumes are typically lower in August . . . and also I think rates markets have become somewhat perplexing to investors and people have a higher degree of risk aversion.”
In the past week, Goldman Sachs’ liquidity index for 5- and 10-year Treasury notes fell well below their 21-day average. Another liquidity metric — JPMorgan’s gauge of market depth — has also recently fallen to the lowest since this March. At the same time, JPMorgan analysts said last week that individual trades were also having a bigger effect on prices; the ability to buy or sell securities without causing big changes in price is another indicator of liquidity.&nbsp;
Minutes from the Fed’s most recent policy meeting revealed disagreement between members about when the central bank might begin withdrawing its $120bn in monthly asset purchases, the first step in unwinding its crisis-era support for the economy. Investors will be watching Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday for any signs of a decision on the timing or pacing of that taper.&nbsp;
It is not just August trading volumes and uncertainty about the Fed’s path that have dried up liquidity. A fall in Treasury yields since mid-May has baffled many investors because it has come even as many economists and the Fed itself have a sanguine outlook for economic growth and the labour market.&nbsp;
“Many clients have not particularly understood how rates markets have moved and that has brought in a degree of caution you wouldn’t normally see,” said Dhingra."
Janet Yellen warns of jump in US borrowing costs amid debt ceiling stand-off,US budget,"Janet Yellen warned the stand-off over the debt ceiling has resulted in a jump in government borrowing costs, as the Treasury secretary doubled down on predictions the US risks running out of cash as early as June 1.
The Treasury’s borrowing costs have increased “substantially for securities maturing in early June”, Yellen noted in a letter sent to congressional leaders on Monday.
She also reiterated her estimate from earlier this month that the so-called X-date — when the government runs out of money and runs the risk of defaulting — could come in 17 days unless lawmakers lift the borrowing limit.
Yields on short-term Treasury bills that mature next month have risen as the debt ceiling impasse has dragged on, reflecting mounting concerns among investors about the prospects for a default. Investors avoided US government bonds maturing around the X-date, forcing the Treasury to pay higher rates at auctions.
In early May, the four-week Treasury bill auction for debt maturing in the first week of June hit a record-high yield of 5.84 per cent. Treasury bills maturing between June 1 and 13 are trading at far higher yields than those coming due before and after.
In a further sign of jitters, the costs to insure US debt via the credit default swap market has soared to a record high.
Yellen’s latest warning comes on the eve of a meeting at the White House including US President Joe Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.
The pair are expected to gather on Tuesday with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries as the White House, congressional leaders and staffers try to avert a crisis that Yellen has predicted could be “catastrophic” for the global economy.
Meanwhile, Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Monday that a default would be “unimaginable”, likening the possibility to a “raging fire”.
“You’d see breakdowns all through the markets,” he said at a conference hosted by the Atlanta Fed, adding that businesses and homeowners would be hit with higher borrowing costs. “It’d be one heck of a mess.”
Biden and congressional leaders first met to talk about the debt ceiling last week, but a subsequent meeting originally set for last Friday was postponed after staffers said they needed more time to negotiate.
The White House and congressional Democrats have demanded a “clean” bill to raise the debt ceiling without preconditions, while Republicans want to tie a higher borrowing limit to steep spending cuts.
At the weekend, people briefed on the talks said a deal was taking shape that would limit domestic spending for several years. Such a deal could also include a clawing-back of unspent coronavirus pandemic relief funds and a speeding-up of the permitting process for big investment projects, the people said.
Biden on Sunday said he was “optimistic” that a deal could be reached. “It’s never good to characterise a negotiation in the middle of the negotiations. I remain optimistic because I am a congenital optimist,” the president told reporters near his house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
“But I really think there is a desire on their part as well as ours to reach an agreement. And I think we’ll be able to do it.”
McCarthy has been much more downbeat in his public remarks. On Sunday he said the two sides were still “far apart”.
“It just seems like they want to look like they are in a meeting, but they are not talking anything serious. It seems more like they want a default than a deal to me.”"
The labour market’s little cracks,US economy,"This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday
Good morning. Yesterday we wrote about the unmoving US stock market and, frankly, were worried the letter would be followed by an embarrassing burst of volatility. So far, though, our luck has held: the S&amp;P 500 rose a meagre 0.9 per cent yesterday. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.
Economic data can be shifty for many reasons, among them weird weather, low response rates or changing laws. But here’s one source of noise you don’t hear nearly as often:
[The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance] is experiencing an increase in fraudulent claim activities where people attempt to gain access to active [unemployment insurance] accounts or file new UI claims using stolen personal information so they can fraudulently obtain unemployment benefits.
Fraud in Massachusetts appears to be, at least in part, behind a sharp uptick in initial UI claims this year, an uptick that has generated a good deal of consternation, including from Unhedged. Ignoring it makes the labour market look better. Deutsche Bank recently simulated counterfactual jobless claims data by swapping Massachusetts for its rough statistical equivalent: two Connecticuts. That change alone lowers the year-to-date rise in initial claims from 17 per cent to 7 per cent. This chart from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, showing seasonally adjusted ex-Mass. claims, visualises it well:
We detail this because the rise in initial claims was core to the labour-market-is-cracking argument. As Aichi Amemiya, Nomura’s US economist, has pointed out to us, labour market data tends to break down in a predictable order towards the end of a cycle. Claims, quits and job openings first, followed by wages and unemployment. But job openings (which some think are dubious data) exploded during the coronavirus pandemic, and still rest nearly 40 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. The quits rate has fallen further but looks more like normalisation than proper cracking:
Unemployment, at 3.4 per cent, has not budged, while wage growth is grinding down ever so slowly:
To repeat, none of this says that the labour market is not cooling, but rather that it is taking its sweet time. If initial claims have risen only 7 per cent or so this year, that fits the wider labour-market picture, yet clashes with expectations for imminent recession. As Santander’s Stephen Stanley wrote yesterday, consensus economic gloom hinges on the labour market deteriorating soon:
The April Bloomberg survey of economists had payrolls contracting in the third quarter and the unemployment rate averaging 4.4 per cent, a full percentage point higher than the current level, in the fourth quarter. In short, the consensus call is for an imminent collapse in the labour market. So, it is not enough that claims are higher than they were six months ago. They need to be surging to justify the current consensus call. And the data clearly indicate this is not happening.
The Fed is reportedly feeling split on whether to raise rates again in June. Doves cite the risk of an overshoot and hawks point to a labour market that has, in one central banker’s words, only gone from “red hot to hot”. Who can blame them?
Earlier this week we looked at first-quarter results from Home Depot, and saw a pattern pretty consistent with what we know, and don’t know, about the US consumer.
The company’s same-store sales are falling in the mid-single digits in nominal terms. In inflation-adjusted terms, the picture is of course uglier: the customer is paying is paying a little less, and getting quite a bit less. And management notes that customers are shying away from big-ticket items and taking on less ambitious home improvement projects. Management’s outlook for the rest of the year came with a wide range. The source of uncertainty is that Home Depot’s leadership doesn’t know how much of the exceptional growth in the pandemic years was driven by demand pulled forward. In inflation-adjusted terms, Home Depot spent the pandemic years growing at a multiple of GDP, and well above its normal trend. What happens now? A return to normal, or a giveback?
On Wednesday we got first-quarter numbers from Target, and they echoed Home Depot’s neatly. Though sales were flat rather than falling, the difference was Target’s big business in food and other non-discretionary items. Management noted that sales trends decelerated through the quarter, and were negative by May. Customers are seeking out discounts. The targets for the rest of the year were, again, spread over a wide range.
On Thursday came Walmart, and while the results appeared to break the pattern, the differences were only superficial. Same-store sales were up more than 7 per cent, and the company is targeting low-single-digit sales growth for the rest of the year. But the sales growth was driven by grocery and pharmacy; clothes and electronics sales fell. And the execs noted that inflation in food is still in the double digits. Walmart is not absorbing these prices in its margin, suggesting flat-to-down sales in real terms. As a discounter, Walmart is doing better than retail broadly, but a consumer slowdown is nonetheless inscribed in its results.
Unhedged’s mantra has been that the US economy is in a slowdown and would be well on its way to a recession were it not for the resilient consumer. Labour market tightness, wage gains and excess savings are giving away only gradually. What we learned from the big retail reports is that while the consumer is not retrenching, exactly, she is noticeably cautious. She still has plenty of money to spend but, having splurged on big-ticket items during the pandemic, when she shops now it is likely for groceries and other basics. Restaurants and businesses that cater to travellers are still doing well — but we will be watching them closely.
Valuation matters.

What to expect as US nears ‘unthinkable’ debt default,US economy,"The US government is weeks away from running out of cash, officials have warned, raising the possibility it will default on its bonds if a political fight in Washington over the debt ceiling is not resolved.
Analysts, economists and industry groups expect the White House and Congress will, as has happened so many times previously, strike a deal and stave off a default.
But Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has warned that, if they do not, then the US may be unable to pay its bills as soon as June 1, a view backed by the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan government agency.
The US would be in default if it did not make scheduled payments to investors holding government debt, known as Treasuries. Among major holders are foreign central banks, which depend on Treasuries and US dollars for their monetary reserves.
The US’s credit rating would then be downgraded. Missing other payments — such as social security and Medicare disbursements or government and military salaries — would not constitute a default, according to Moody’s and S&amp;P.
Some Republicans in Congress have discussed the possibility of the Treasury prioritising bond payments if a default is close. But Yellen has rebuffed that idea and called making debt payments but delaying others a “default by another name”.
Analysis from the White House suggests a shortlived default would result in half a million lost jobs and a 0.6 per cent decline in gross domestic product. A default that drags on for longer could lead to 8.3mn job losses and a 6.1 per cent decline in GDP. Borrowing costs in both scenarios would rise.
A default “would trash the credit score of the United States government. And it would take a long time to repair, just like it does with an individual”, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan. Because of that downgrade, “US taxpayers would have to pay far more in taxes for decades to come”.
The US is responsible for making big interest and principal payments on bonds around the so-called X-date, the day when the government runs out of money.
Interest payments on Treasuries are made on the 15th and the last day of each month. The end of month payment for May is expected to be between $10bn and $16bn, according to estimates from the CBO. In June, the mid-month payment will be about $3bn, while the end-of-month payment could be between $10bn and $16bn.
Investors own roughly $90bn in Treasuries maturing at the end of May, and $138bn maturing throughout June that the Treasury is responsible for paying out, according to estimates from TD Securities.
Large payments for domestic commitments, such as healthcare and social security, are also due in the coming weeks.
The CBO estimates the Treasury has about $360bn available for May and early June, until additional quarterly tax payments come in on June 15.
“The first couple weeks in June are going to be very dicey,” said William Hoagland, a vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Riskier assets such as US stocks and corporate bonds would face large losses. US bonds and the dollar are traditionally haven assets for investors in volatile periods so, paradoxically, they may rise in value immediately after a default — even though the default would be on US debt. That is because investors say the willingness and ability of the US to pay its bondholders is ultimately not in question.
An outright US default is “unthinkable” as it would “wreak havoc” on global financial markets, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Bank of America’s monthly fund manager survey shows 29 per cent of managers expect no resolution to the impasse, up from 20 per cent in April.
But for holders of insurance on US government bonds, the price of which has risen to record highs recently as default fears have grown, a potentially enormous payout awaits.
Credit default swaps are contracts between two market participants, one of whom agrees to make a payment if the issuer defaults on its debt. The size of that payment is in effect the difference between the original value of a bond and its current market value.
The bond used to determine that payout is typically the cheapest one on the market issued by the borrower. The difference in price between the cheapest bond on the market and the one for which the insurance was purchased is not always huge. But for a US default it is, because the steep rise in interest rates since early 2022 means there are Treasury bonds in circulation that are trading at a large discount — below 60 cents on the dollar.
That could mean an enormous return for holders of CDS, provided that the US does not make a payment on its bonds within three days, the grace period allowed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
For those buying protection via CDS, “if (they) get lucky and [Washington] DC screws up, (they) get to settle against this really cheap bond that wouldn’t normally exist except we’ve had this enormous increase in interest rates”, said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “The payout is going to be much higher than it has been in the past, because of interest rates.”
Fed chair Jay Powell has been adamant that the central bank is limited in its capacity to offset any damage triggered by a default, although officials have in the past outlined ways in which it could act.
For instance, in transcripts from deliberations in 2011 and 2013 — other years featuring debt stand-offs — the central bank discussed using regular tools such as removing securities from the market overnight and lending out cash through its repo operations, or even purchasing Treasuries outright.
But that could mean the Fed has to halt its plan to reduce the size of its balance sheet.
Another alternative was for the Fed to remove defaulted Treasury securities from circulation, either purchasing the affected notes or swapping those for others it owned. In 2013 Powell, then a governor, called the options “loathsome”, although he did admit that “under certain circumstances” he could potentially consider supporting such solutions.

Algorithms prop up the market as fretful humans sit out the uncertainty,US equities,"While human portfolio managers fret over economic uncertainty and the health of the US banking system, some algorithmically driven hedge funds have been buying stocks at one of the fastest rates in a decade, according to bank trading desks.
Quant funds have been piling into US stock markets in response to falling volatility, helping to prop up the market as active managers sit on the sidelines.
“Systematic reallocation has really been the [main] source of demand outside of corporate buybacks” this year, said Charlie McElligott, an equity derivatives strategist at Nomura.
Quant, or systematic, funds use algorithms to automatically detect trends and ride momentum across different markets.
A recent research note from Bank of America summed up the views of many investors by declaring the “bulls are becoming an endangered species”. But the trend among quant funds helps to explain why the US stock market has proven surprisingly resilient this year despite the widespread pessimism, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8 per cent year to date.
“These funds move fast and unemotionally,” said McElligott. “They’re not parsing through earnings or taking a view on the stickiness of inflation . . . this is about price trends and momentum.”
There are several types of systematic strategies, including “volatility control” funds, commodity trading adviser funds, and “risk parity” funds. Their approaches vary, but all three rely on realised and expected market volatility as critical drivers of where they allocate assets.
Nomura estimates that vol control funds alone have added about $72bn in US stocks in the past three months. That was a greater flow than in 80 per cent of three-month periods over the past decade. Separate analysis by Deutsche Bank showed overall equities positioning across systematic funds is at its highest level since December 2021.
In contrast, stock market exposure among active managers is close to a one-year low, according to Deutsche.
Wild swings in markets throughout 2022 encouraged systematic funds to reduce their exposure or even bet on further declines, exacerbating the downturn. The S&amp;P fell 19 per cent last year. However, volatility has fallen dramatically since the fourth quarter as fears about US interest rate rises and the health of the global economy have eased.
The Vix index, which reflects expected stock market swings over the next month, has closed below its long-term average 57 times so far this year, compared with just 23 times in the whole of 2022. In April, Cboe’s backwards-looking index of realised volatility hit its lowest level since November 2021, and even after a recent pick-up it remains less than half last year’s average.
Those falls automatically prompt many quant funds to ramp up their stock investments, according to McElligott.
“Discretionary investors have basically refused to engage with this rally so far,” said Parag Thatte, a strategist at Deutsche. He said investors briefly began increasing their allocation to US stocks after a strong start to the year in January, but have been put off again since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March triggered broader worries about the US banking sector.
Low exposure to stocks has contributed to poor performance among many investors. Two-thirds of actively managed mutual funds failed to beat their benchmark in the first quarter as portfolio managers were caught off guard by the rally, according to Bank of America.
Still, while flows from quant funds have helped to prop up stock indices, they have not been enough to offset losses elsewhere in many hedge funds’ portfolios. CTAs were hit badly by sharp moves in Treasury markets, and a Société Générale index tracking the largest funds has fallen 4 per cent so far this year.
Quant funds are relatively small compared to the overall market. CTAs had total assets under management of about $365bn at the end of 2022, according to BarclayHedge, less than 10 per cent of the $4.8tn hedge fund industry.
However, because multiple funds tend to follow trends in tandem, their flows can affect the broader market, particularly when other investors are avoiding making any bets.
“We do see their trading has a big impact on equities,” said Thatte. “They don’t tend to lead the market . . . [but] they tend to amplify moves that are already happening.”
He added, however, that with quants now approaching normal levels of equity allocation, their impact may soften going forward.
“If discretionary investors continue to be underweight and not raise their own exposure, there’s a limit to how much systematics can do on their own.”"

Good morning. Yesterday, Western Alliance Bancorporation announced its deposit levels have continued to recover. That sparked a broad rally in bank shares. Can we declare the banking micro-crisis of 2023 over? Regional bank indices are still off by 25 per cent since Silicon Valley stumbled in March. But it seems that we are through the acute phase, at the very least. Disagree? Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.
Also, listen to Katie Martin and Harriet Agnew on why no one wants to list in London.
The S&amp;P 500 is where it was 45 days ago and volatility is missing in action. Since the start of April, there have been just six trading days where the S&amp;P has risen or fallen more than 1 per cent, including yesterday, and zero days with a 2 per cent move in any direction.
What gives? The trivial answer: the forces tugging US stocks up are, roughly, equal and opposite to those pushing stocks down. In a recent note, Citi trading strategist Stuart Kaiser offers a more substantive answer. He identifies four countervailing forces pushing in each direction. Those pushing stocks up are:
Many funds have already offloaded risk. In other words, a lot of selling has already happened. Kaiser points out that US large-cap mutual funds ended 2022 with the lowest average beta (ie, generic market exposure) in at least a decade.
Having de-risked, investors are sitting on a lot of cash. This, too, suggests selling has already occurred. Portfolios can be easily rebalanced back towards equities, should opportunities arise. The chart below shows cash allocations in the latest Bank of America fund manager survey, which are still high but have fallen since late 2022. The drop has coincided with this year’s AI hype rally. That is probably not a coincidence.
Investors bought lots of protection, guarding against forced selling. The Cboe Skew index captures investor demand for downside hedges, based on the pricing of out-of-the-money options. As the chart below shows, the Skew index is well above longer-term averages. Demand for protection remains high relative to history, and that, Kaiser argues, means fewer investors forced to sell by a surprise lurch lower:
Systematic funds that buy when volatility is low are pumping money into the market. As the FT’s Nicholas Megaw has reported, quants are playing a powerful role in this market. The main culprits are “volatility control” funds, whose mandates focus on a volatility target, rather than a returns target. When vol is high, they sell; when it is low, they buy. This, alongside share buybacks, has lent the market a steady source of demand. Nomura estimates the purchases at $72bn over the past three months; for context, daily S&amp;P 500 buyback demand is about $4bn-$5bn per day, according to Citi.
The forces weighing down on stocks are more familiar:
‘Tina’ is dead; there are alternatives. Equities need a lot more upside now to impress and, with the arguable exception of tech stocks, few segments look like they can deliver. As one portfolio manager told us yesterday: “From hedge funds to private banks and retail, my clients are all telling me: Why do I need to own equities? Treasuries are at 4 per cent. I hit that bid all day. I can get as much risk-reward living within fixed income, without needing to consider equities.”
Stock valuations aren’t terribly enticing anyway. Standard p/e’s are slightly above historical averages, the Shiller cyclically adjusted p/e ratio is very high and the equity risk premium is near a decade low. If there is a valuation metric that makes the market look cheap, we haven’t seen it.
Risks to growth and corporate earnings are ever-present. Unhedged can’t stop writing about them. Bottom-up analyst earnings estimates are still for modest 2 per cent EPS growth this year and a return to strong growth in 2024:
Options dealers may be selling shares in bulk. Based on option open interest, Kaiser suspects dealers may be holding large inventories of call options expiring between now and the end of June. If that’s right, dealers hedging that inventory would be selling stock into the market, though Kaiser added in an interview that this is “our impression based on conversations with clients” and could be a “wild card”.
The punchline here is that stocks are paralysed, needing a hard shove to start moving decisively. So what might unstick stocks? A debt-ceiling disaster or much worse economic data could well restart the bear market. On the upside, it’s tough for us to see what might do the trick. Kaiser imagines a soft landing and dovish Federal Reserve pivot could drive up equities by “creating a Fomo moment”. Maybe so; as we wrote last week, the soft-landing dream has not died yet. But in the meantime, there is much else to fear besides missing out. (Ethan Wu)
Last week the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed a special assessment on banks, designed to recover the costs of protecting uninsured depositors in the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assessment would make the banks that benefited the most from the protection of uninsured depositors — that is, those with the most uninsured deposits — pay the most.
It would work like this: banks will pay the equivalent of 12 basis points of all uninsured deposits over $5bn each year for two years, with payments coming quarterly. How big a hit to earnings and capital is this? The FDIC says:
Assuming that the effects on capital and income of the entire amount of the special assessment would occur in one quarter only, it is estimated to result in an average one-quarter reduction in income of 17.5 per cent
Banks that had a lot of uninsured deposits at the end of 2022 (the balance sheet date on which the assessment is to be calculated) would take a somewhat bigger hit. Take Comerica for example, which had $45bn in uninsured deposits as of December 22. That puts its proposed fee at $97mn over two years — 1.6 per cent of its current equity, and about a third of its net income last quarter.
So it is unsurprising that the leaders of the banking industry might like the FDIC to consider another idea. The WSJ reports:
Banks have spent the past week or so testing what would be a clever gambit: Paying billions of dollars they collectively owe to replenish a federal deposit insurance fund using Treasuries instead of cash.
The idea — floated to regulators and lawmakers by PNC Financial Services Group and supported by others — could allow banks to take securities that are currently worth, say, 90 cents on the dollar, and give them to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp at full price . ..
An FDIC spokeswoman said the agency’s rules don’t allow banks to pay it in Treasuries
The obvious problem here is that, as the FDIC points out, it would require a rule change to make this proposal work, and by the time that gets done, who knows where the banks will be. But putting that aside, you might argue that the Treasuries have discounted market values because rates have risen, but if the FDIC holds the Treasuries to maturity, it will ultimately get paid in full.
If you argued this way, you would be wrong. A Treasury that is trading at 90 cents on the dollar is really worth 90 cents; it is not worth 90 cents unless you can hold it to maturity in which case it is worth 100 cents. The time value of money and duration risk are real things with real prices. The banks are just saying “we would like to pay less, please”.
Alternatively, you might argue that the FDIC could actually save money by taking the Treasuries at face value, because doing so would take mark-to-market losses and duration risk off the bank’s balance sheets. This would make the banks less risky, leaving the FDIC with fewer potential messes to clean up later. But this is wrong too. The FDIC could just lower the assessment, and the cash left on the banks’ balance sheets would have a similar risk-reducing effect.
The banks’ idea is just sleight of hand. The FDIC should wave it away, if they have not already.

Gensler says SEC to review payment for order flow,US financial regulation,"The top US stock market regulator is looking to change the rules around share trading, including fees paid by large Wall Street groups to handle customers’ orders, after January’s explosion in “meme stocks” highlighted what he called “inefficiencies” in the market.
Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Wednesday that he had asked the agency’s staff to make recommendations to amend a host of market structure rules — an announcement that sent shares in the trading company Virtu Financial down 7.7 per cent.
The review will cover the controversial issue of payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages receive fees from market makers such as Virtu and Susquehanna to handle their trades. In return they promise to execute the trade at, or at better than, current market prices.
The SEC would also look at apps that encourage “gamification” of trading through email alerts, prompts and moving images to entice investors, Gensler said.
“The question is whether our equity markets are as efficient as they could be in light of the technological changes and recent developments,” he said at a conference held by Piper Sandler in New York.
Many of the issues came to the forefront of regulators’ and policymakers’ attention in January, when day traders swapping ideas on the social media site Reddit and using the trading platforms Robinhood drove shares in GameStop and other companies dramatically higher.
The outsized moves drew attention to payment for order flow and the dominance of one group, the privately held Citadel Securities, which executes nearly half of all retail trades in the US. Virtu is the second-largest market maker.
New rules could also have implications for the business models of brokerages — not least Robinhood, which is readying an initial public offering — because the payment for order flow that they receive subsidies zero-commission equity trading for customers.
“Brokers profit when investors trade,” Gensler said. “For those brokers who have these arrangements — and not all do — higher trading volume generates more payment for order flow. What makes the current zero-commission brokerage environment different is that investors do not see their costs as they’re executing trades, so they may perceive them as free.”
In a statement after Gensler’s remarks, Robinhood said it “looks forward to engaging with the SEC through its formal rulemaking process as it considers changes to the current market structure, which is working so well for an increasingly diverse universe of investors”.
Gensler had expressed concern about payment for order flow on several occasions since becoming SEC chair in April, but his comments on Wednesday suggested he intended to follow through with a full review of market structure.
He indicated staff would also look at minimum pricing increments for stocks and the rules that ensure customers get the best possible price for their deals, enshrined in a system known as the National Best Bid and Offer.
He also questioned whether the US system for ensuring that customers got the best price was sufficiently comprehensive since existing rules do not cover deals done on banks’ internal trading books and private marketplaces known as dark pools.
The SEC chair backed calls to cut the time it takes to settle US equity trades from the current two days, after some market participants, including the retail brokerage Robinhood, cited it as a critical factor in decisions to restrict trading in some meme stocks in January.
“I’m reminded of an old saying in the markets,” Gensler said. “Time equals risk.”"
US financial watchdog backs tougher rules for hedge fund disclosures,US financial regulation,"Wall Street’s top regulator has voted in favour of proposed rules that would force hedge funds to report immediately when they suffer extreme losses or large investor withdrawals, in a bid to close gaps that were exposed by market ructions last year.
The guidelines from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday are part of a suite of new standards designed to strengthen the stability of US financial markets. Commissioners also backed plans for more transparency in the $23tn market for US government debt, which underpins global finance. The rules will now be submitted for public comment.
The collapse of Archegos, a so-called family office that managed the wealth of Bill Hwang, last year forced banks across Wall Street to report losses of more than $10bn when a series of highly concentrated bets which used derivatives backfired. While Archegos would not be subject to the new rules, hedge funds and private equity funds that follow a similar strategy would be within scope of the updated guidance, officials said.
Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, said US authorities’ analysis of hedge fund reporting requirements over the past decade had identified “significant information gaps”. “For example, we would benefit from more timely information during fast-moving market events such as the March 2020 dysfunction in the Treasury market,” he said.
Many hedge funds and private equity firms have historically provided only limited disclosures about their activities in spite of significant growth over the past 10 years. Private funds’ assets under management have more than doubled from approximately $5tn in 2013 to $11tn by the end of 2020, according to the SEC. The number of funds jumped 70 per cent in the same period.
The SEC wants to speed up disclosures to just one business day if a hedge fund suffers an extraordinary loss, significant margin calls, events that lead to large client withdrawals, big declines in its cash position or any material changes in its relationships with prime brokers — the investment banks that provide finance.
Hedge funds often face margin calls — demands to provide more cash or US Treasury bonds as security for borrowed money — from their banks in periods of market volatility or when they suffer large losses.
The changes also include reducing the reporting threshold for private equity managers from $2bn to $1.5bn in assets under management. That would ensure the same proportion of the private equity industry was covered as when the reporting standard&nbsp;was first adopted in 2013, SEC officials said.
Reforms to the Treasury market follow a series of incidents in the past decade that have tested its durability and as the volume of outstanding US debt has mushroomed.
In the past 15 years, the market has shifted from one primarily conducted between banks and broking middlemen to one dominated by high-speed traders on electronic platforms. Corporate bonds are also increasingly traded electronically rather than over the phone.
The amended rules aim to capture platforms trading corporate or government securities that fall outside the scope of the SEC, by making them comply with existing standards that protect investors, promote fair and orderly markets and maintain the technological infrastructure underpinning US financial markets.
The new regulation would bring approximately 20 companies across security asset classes under the SEC’s purview, officials said. These companies would either register with the SEC as exchanges or operate as alternative trading systems, meaning they would register as broker dealers, SEC officials said.
Some functionalities of platforms such as Tradeweb or MarketAxess might fall under the new “exchange” definition proposed by the SEC, officials said.
“Together, I believe that these steps would promote resilience and greater access in the Treasury market, which forms the base for so much of the rest of our capital markets,” Gensler said."
"Investors must focus on margins in era of high rates, says Warburg Pincus boss",US inflation,"Higher interest rates have so fundamentally shifted the financial environment that investors must focus on a company’s ability to maintain margins rather than just its growth prospects, veteran private equity executive Chip Kaye said.
“This moment is different than anything we have had in the 40 years before . . . with inflation proving stickier and interest rates higher than currently expected — and more complicated great-power politics adding to that dynamic,” said Kaye, who started at Warburg Pincus in 1986 and has been its chief executive for two decades.
“If you could pick one characteristic of a business and that’s how you decide whether to invest, it would be pricing,” he told the Financial Times. “Lean into businesses that feel like they have the ability to adapt to a higher-inflation environment.”
This moment is different than anything we have had in the 40 years before
Warburg Pincus is a traditional private equity firm with more than $80bn in assets under management that focused on growth investment. Unlike competitors that have sprawled into other areas and listed publicly, it is still a partnership.
Kaye said that when the firm looks at a potential investment’s product, whether in goods or services, it considers, “what are the alternatives, what is the ease of switching, and what is the contribution to the customer’s end-product?” Kaye said.
The flip side of that advice is that Kaye looks sceptically at lossmaking technology businesses that can no longer rely on free-flowing investor cash to subsidise their services. “When a $4 taco costs $1 to have it delivered, that’s one thing. When the $4 taco costs $8 with delivery, that’s different,” he said.
Pricing power may vary depending on the situation. If something is a relatively small part of the overall cost, customers may not bother to switch suppliers if the price goes up.
It can also be controversial. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts suggested this year that some companies were using pandemic-era shortages to push up margins, dubbing the process “greedflation”, although groups such as Procter &amp; Gamble have hit back.
Kaye argued that Warburg does not seek that kind of profit growth. Instead it works “with portfolio companies across every function to help drive efficiency . . . These steps ultimately deliver better value at lower cost and position companies for stable growth.”
Overall, he said, investors are having to come to terms with mistakes made in 2021 and earlier. “We all misread the pandemic. We read it as a demand shock and it wasn’t really — it was more a substitution of goods for services.”
“In today’s markets, we are seeing some of the consequences of that natural tendency to underappreciate risk when times are good,” he said.
“The investing environment will be more challenging — but the opportunity to differentiate should be exciting to investors.”"
"Congress could vote on debt ceiling bill next week, Kevin McCarthy says",US politics & policy,"Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House Speaker, said a bill&nbsp;to raise the US debt ceiling could be put to a vote as early as next week, offering hope that the White House and Congress will strike a deal to avert default ahead of the June 1 deadline.
“We’re not there, we haven’t agreed to anything yet. But I see the path that we can come to an agreement,” McCarthy told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning. “I think we have a structure now and everybody's working hard. I mean we're working two or three times a day, then going back getting more numbers.”
His comments are among the most optimistic&nbsp;he has delivered on the debt ceiling crisis, matching the upbeat tone coming from the White House earlier in the week. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was “confident” a deal could be reached to avoid an unprecedented and potentially economically devastating default that could come early next month if Congress fails to act.
Following the reports of progress on deal talks, US stocks jumped. Both the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite reached their highest levels since August 2022, up 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. The yield on the one-month Treasury bill, which in recent days hit multi-decade highs on debt ceiling fears, dipped modestly.
McCarthy’s comments come as House Republicans and White House negotiators have plunged into detailed talks on a possible compromise, which would probably involve limits on discretionary spending, legislation to streamline permitting for big investment projects, and new work requirements for social safety net programmes. In a sign that the talks were advancing, McCarthy praised White House negotiators Shalanda Young, the budget director, and Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden’s closest advisers.
The president is in Japan for the G7 leaders summit, but is being kept updated on the talks by Bruce Reed, his deputy chief of staff, who is travelling with him. Biden is returning to Washington on Sunday to oversee the final stretch of the talks, cutting short a trip that was supposed to include stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia.
Any agreement would have to pass both the House and the Senate before reaching Biden’s desk for his signature, meaning there could be turbulence and uncertainty in the days ahead.
As the negotiations intensified in recent days, the president faced growing calls from members of his own Democratic party to invoke the 14th amendment of the constitution and ignore the debt ceiling entirely, rather than make concessions on spending and aid to the poor that could harm the economy. It is also still unclear whether McCarthy can make an agreement with Biden without facing a huge backlash from the hardline pro-Donald Trump wing of the Republican party, and a possible challenge to his speakership."
‘Welfare to work’ rules become sticking point in US debt ceiling fight,US politics & policy,"The prospect of stricter work requirements for people on social safety net programmes has become a sticking point in negotiations over raising the US debt ceiling, as lawmakers rush to strike a deal before the Treasury runs out of cash as soon as June 1.
Kevin McCarthy, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, said this week that tougher work requirements for recipients of several existing safety net programmes were a “red line” for him in crunch talks with the White House over raising the debt ceiling.
President Joe Biden has in recent days signalled an openness to some reforms to the social safety net, but those remarks have attracted ire from progressive Democrats and exposed the thorny politics of welfare policy for both parties. The potential for a revolt from the left of Biden’s own party complicates his path towards securing a deal in the closely divided Congress.
The clash has prompted some Democrats to insist that Biden take the unprecedented step of invoking the 14th amendment to the Constitution to circumvent the debt ceiling and continue issuing new debt to pay its obligations without legislative approval.
Republicans, who control the House, want to tie a higher borrowing limit to steep spending cuts. They have long pushed for stricter requirements for people claiming government assistance to be participating in the workforce.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, taken together, the Republican calls for stricter work requirements would cut federal spending by $120bn over the next decade.
Biden acknowledged on Wednesday that, while serving in the Senate, he had voted for a 1996 welfare reform package that made sweeping changes, many of which remain in place after being signed into law by president Bill Clinton.
While Democrats largely supported those limitations on government aid almost three decades ago, they have rejected them in recent years.
“These requirements don’t result in more people moving to work: they increase food insecurity, decrease access to healthcare and often result in higher costs to the states and federal government,” said Jean Ross, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank.
While Biden appeared to reject work requirements for Medicaid recipients on Wednesday — insisting that he was “not going to accept any work requirements that’s going to impact on medical health needs of people” — he left the door open to stricter rules for other programmes, saying: “It’s possible there could be a few others, but not anything of consequence.”
House Republicans have also called for reforms to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides welfare payments to families with children in poverty, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, previously called the food stamp programme, which helps low-income people buy food. Both programmes already require most recipients to be in work.
While adults claiming Snap who are aged 50 or younger are required to demonstrate that they are in work, Republicans want to increase the age threshold to 56. The CBO says that would result in about 275,000 Americans losing access to the benefits. But Republicans argue the changes would bolster workforce participation and boost the overall economy.
“What we have found with every statistical data, it helps people get a job, it helps our supply chain, it helps the economy and the individual even stronger. And that is what we should be doing,” McCarthy told CNBC on Wednesday.
Many Democrats disagree. David Scott, the top Democrat on the House agriculture committee, said: “Taking food away from low-income households under the guise of ‘work requirements’ does not create jobs. It does not encourage work. It only serves to make life harder for people.”
Progressive members of Biden’s party have threatened to vote against any compromise. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic congresswoman from New York, said the White House can “expect pushback on nearly any significant concession”.
“It’s unbelievable to be back in this fight,” said Lindsay Owens of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think-tank. “I think there’s a growing chorus of senators and members of the House who would be unable to vote for any deal that includes any work requirements.”
Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island and chair of the budget committee, said it was time for Biden to invoke the 14th amendment, which says the validity of US debt “shall not be questioned”, and keep borrowing above the limit rather than continue negotiating.
It remains unclear whether McCarthy will be able to rally all of his members around the proposals. While most Republicans have backed the idea of stricter work requirements, a handful who represent swing districts and face difficult re-election bids next year have been reluctant to sign on to the idea.
Others have suggested the debate could be punted to later in the year, when lawmakers are likely to face another tough fight over the farm bill, a multiyear law that governs agricultural and food programmes.
“We know we’re not going to get everything,” Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told reporters on Capitol Hill this week. “If we get three, four compromises, that’s a success.”"
Unpicking the US deposit insurance debate,US,"Todd Baker is a senior fellow at the Richman Center for Business, Law &amp; Public Policy at Columbia.
US banking has always been a risky business. The financial panics of 1819, 1837, 1873, 1907 and 1931-32 all sparked banking crises, recessions or full-scale depressions. Depositors lost everything every time a bank failed. But the Great Depression was the trigger for a seismic change.
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) during the Great Depression to stop the rolling banking panic by guaranteeing bank deposits. It was originally up to $2,500 in per eligible account — an amount quickly raised to $5,000 or about $112,000 in today’s dollars — and subsequently raised six times over the years to the current $250,000 limit.
At the same time, the US developed a comprehensive system of bank regulation to complement deposit insurance, including strict separation of banking from securities and other commercial activities. Banks effectively became private/public hybrids, with a federal deposit backstop and comprehensive regulation combined with private capital to enable banks to fulfil their critical role in maturity transformation with relative efficiency.
For a long time, it seemed like this private/public system worked perfectly. Bank runs stopped for almost 90 years, most banks were consistently profitable, failures were rare and, as the FDIC proudly states, “no insured depositor has lost a penny.” Losses were repaid through assessments on banks, and the prevailing view was that the theoretical problems of moral hazard and “private gains-public losses” were largely contained.
Here’s the FDIC ruminating on its own history in 1998, with Alphaville’s emphasis:
In its seventh decade, federal deposit insurance remains an integral part of the nation’s financial system, although some have argued at different points in time that there have been too few bank failures because of deposit insurance, that it undermines market discipline, that the current coverage limit of $100,000 is too high, and that it amounts to a federal subsidy for banking companies. Each of these concerns may be valid to some extent, yet the public appears to remain convinced that a deposit insurance program is worth the cost, which ultimately is borne by them. The severity of the 1930s banking crisis has not been repeated, but bank deposit insurance was harshly tested in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The system emerged battered but sound and, with some legislative tweaking, better suited to the more volatile, higher-risk financial environment that has evolved in the last quarter of the 20th century.
Oops. The 2008 financial crisis shattered that illusion, and this year’s expensive failures at Silicon Valley Bank and others show that the system has not returned to a state of stability. That was ably visualised by Toby Nangle here:
Where did things go wrong?
Many things have changed in the economy over the 90 years since the FDIC was created and the modern regulatory architecture was designed. “Shareholder value maximisation” theory gradually undermined traditional bank management conservatism, the 3-6-3 rule and the assumption that reasonable but stable returns were enough for banks.
Once shareholders grew more active and bank managers began to be compensated through equity awards tied to the bank’s stock price, they were strongly incentivised to take risks to generate personal wealth. The steady financialisation of the US economy and a wave of deregulation blurred the lines between boring banking and high-risk investment and capital markets activities.
Many new financial players and myriad new ways to create financial leverage, risk and return came into existence, like securitisation, private equity, derivative trading, venture capital, shadow banks, high speed trading, money market funds and private debt providers, to name only a few. Bank managers seeking to add risk had many new tools to choose from.
What had been a grand bargain with government — in which banks agreed to run their businesses conservatively, hold excess capital and liquid resources, only do certain useful and relatively low risk things and be subject to strict supervision in exchange for the business model stability that federal deposit insurance brought — turned into unbalanced and unbridled private risk-taking, subsidised by a public backstop.
The recent banking shenanigans show that post-crisis reforms have helped, but not sufficiently tamed these issues. As Stanford’s Anat Admati says:
When I say the banking system is too fragile, I am often told, “Things are just fine. It’s a good system. The rules were reformed.” Some of us have been arguing for years that these narratives are false and misleading. The failure to write proper rules in banking goes back decades.
The reform efforts after the financial crisis of 2007-09 — which was a direct result of terrible rules — have been pretty much a mess. Some were akin to reducing the speed limit for loaded trucks from 98 miles per hour to 95 miles per hour without even measuring the speed properly. Politicians and regulators are failing us. And when the flaw in the system becomes visible, as in 2008 or now, they cover up their failures and provide bailouts if that seems better than the alternatives. Then the public stops paying attention and bank lobbyists make sure the rules continue to tolerate recklessness.
Leading voices in finance, policy and academic circles are arguing that the source of the problem can be found in the deposit insurance system and that something about deposit insurance needs to change.
Mainstream pundits have proposed things like expanding insurance to cover all deposits; adding layers of regulation to control the risk du jour; creating specialised money-market funds with loss-absorbing capacity instead of deposits; privatising parts of the insurance system. Fringe commentators have even espoused solutions involving crypto and stablecoins (sigh), narrow banking and even a return to the good old days of wildcat banks.
It’s worth noting that there never has been a true consensus about the purpose and limits of deposit insurance. Even president Franklin Roosevelt (a surprising opponent) described deposit insurance as “dangerous,” for in time it “would lead to laxity in bank management and carelessness on the part of both banker and depositor.”
At his very first press conference Roosevelt’s scepticism was apparent in an off-the-record briefing for journalists:
I can tell you as to guaranteeing bank deposits my own views and I think those of the old administration. It is that the general underlying thought behind the use of the word “guaranty” with respect to bank deposits is that you guaranty bad banks as well as good banks and the minute the government starts to do that the government runs into a probable loss.
The whole objective of the plan we are working on can be stated this way: There are undoubtedly some banks that are not going to pay 100% on the dollar. We all know it is better to have that loss taken than jeopardize the credit of the United States Government or to put the United States Government further in debt, and therefore, the one objective is going to be to keep the loss in individual banks down to a minimum, endeavoring to get 100% on them, but not having the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and not putting a premium on the future of unsound banking.
(While this view still prevails among those dedicated to the idea that deposit insurance creates moral hazard risk, there’s no good evidence that this happens in practice.)
Some think deposit insurance is a consumer protection tool, like limits on credit card fraud losses. Others view it as one of the pillars necessary to control funding volatility and shore up the eternally fragile lend-long/fund-short model of banking. New ways to spread money around banks have made the cap on insurance is essentially meaningless to savvy consumers, so it should surprise no one that the current $250,000 limit was dreamt up by Congressional staff as a sweetener to get a larger bill passed, without any analysis.
Isn’t it possible that we’re asking the wrong question about how to fix problems with banking system stability?
Maybe we shouldn’t do anything to change the deposit insurance system, beyond the FDIC’s eminently reasonable suggestion of greater protection for business operating and payroll accounts. And maybe more regulation isn’t the answer either, as it’s hard to argue that regulation and regulators have proven effective in addressing the novel and fast-moving circumstances that lead to bank failures.
As for returning to the low-risk world of Glass-Steagall? Even a supermajority in Congress couldn’t unbake that cake.
Maybe, just maybe, the best way to reduce risk in the banking system and restore the balance in the Depression-era bargain is through people?
After all, it is human error that causes bank failures. Citibank, Bank of America, Wachovia and Washington Mutual all failed in 2008 (three were bailed out and one was seized and sold) because managers fatally misunderstood mortgage risk. Silicon Valley Bank failed this year because its executives made a ruinous bet on interest rates and deposit duration that its board failed to adequately understand or control.
When it comes to people — whether it’s Chuck Prince saying “you’ve got to keep dancing while the music is playing” or Greg Becker deciding to spin the roulette wheel on interest rates and durations — you get what you reward. Change the incentives and you change the outcomes.
There is some precedent for thinking incentives are important in banking. In the days when bankers were compensated with salaries, cars, retirement plans, country club memberships and prestige instead of equity-based bonuses, they had little incentive to ramp up risks for maximum return at the cost of safety.
They did well as long as the bank stayed healthy, even if financial performance was only “above average”. They also spent as much time thinking about customers, employees and communities as they did thinking about shareholder returns.
While this system was by no means perfect (this was the source of economists’ dreaded “agency cost” problem which in part led to the equitisation of executive pay), a revised approach to incentives could help restore the Depression-era banking bargain, and tip the balance back towards systemic stability.
Let’s start by banning equity-based compensation for bank management and boards. A total ban goes far beyond what was contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act Section 956, which was meant to curb compensation plans that encourage bankers from taking inappropriate risks but has had only a small impact.
Congress actually required regulatory agencies to finalise a rule implementing Section 956 by May 2011, but it has never happened. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ As senator Gary Peters — one of the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act — wrote to regulators including Gary Gensler and Jay Powell in March:
Section 956 of Dodd-Frank was intended to require financial regulators to quickly and collaboratively issue rules requiring financial institutions to disclose any incentive-based executive compensation arrangements that encourage excessive risk-taking at financial institutions or that may lead to financial loss. The recent bank failure of Silicon Valley Bank and reported bonuses issued to its leadership further underscore the urgency and importance of this rule’s implementation. Given how incentive-based compensation can continue to lead to certain financial institutions and professionals taking excessive and reckless risks, implementation of this long-delayed rule is an important reform to ensure reckless financial risks and financial mismanagement do not put our banking system at risk.
So why a total ban? Well, equity-based compensation just isn’t appropriate in the private/public hybrid banking model.
Bank managers in effect serve two masters — the board/shareholders and the FDIC insurance fund and its backer, the US Treasury — so bank executive bonuses and director compensation should be based on balanced targets serving the needs of both masters, with a mix of profitability, risk management and other metrics, and large holdbacks for subsequent negative or positive developments.
The same concepts should apply for line manager and “risk-taker” compensation — balanced scorecards with risk management as well as profitability targets and extended holdbacks. The total amount of compensation isn’t the problem. It’s the behaviours incentivised by the compensation structure.
More fundamentally, we probably need to rethink which parts of our corporate law should be applicable to private/public hybrid institutions. As Martin Wolf pointed out recently, they should be seen as quasi-utilities:
We get pretty upset if all the electricity got cut off because our electric utility failed to manage perfectly obvious risks. And in the same way, we expect banks to continue to function. And the way we’ve ensured that is to give essentially an open-ended guarantee from the state that we will allow them to do so . . .  . . . I think that to me, the essential point is that banks are, really are utilities. They’re not and shouldn’t be the prime risk-takers in the economy. That’s what we have equity for. And if they are to be seen as utilities, they don’t need to be vastly profitable. They need to be run as utilities and be capitalised in ways that ensure that they will survive in tough times. Because surviving in tough times is the most important thing banks can do.
Even if you don’t see them as de facto utilities, it’s clear that banks really aren’t like other companies, and corporate law should recognise that difference.
State and federal law should be changed to explicitly require bank boards to consider the interests of the FDIC insurance fund and the larger economy in the exercise of their fiduciary duty as corporate directors. And the FDIC should be able to sue them if they don’t.
These solutions aren’t very complex, nor do they require new deposit insurance structures based on economic theories that have regularly failed to conform to our human-centred reality in practice. Will they work? It’s certainly worth a try?
The structural changes adopted with great fanfare after 2008 didn’t stop SVB from collapsing, taking a couple of other banks with it, and requiring a $16bn refill of the insurance deposit scheme.
Maybe incentive changes would have caused management at Silicon Valley to think twice, and consider the impact on their personal pocketbooks before they created a balance sheet that breached all their internal risk limits and turned into a loaded gun pointed at the FDIC and their shareholders."
Growth stocks win again,Unhedged,"This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday
Good morning. Tiger Global is looking to sell a big chunk of its portfolio of private companies in to the secondary market. It needs the cash to pay its investors. We’ll see more stories like this in the months to come; the economic cycle applies to private assets too. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.
On Friday we wrote that the various economic reports and indicators are now, for the first time in a while, “singing from the same hymnal”. We are in a clear and pronounced slowdown, offset only by a seemly irrepressible consumer (who may soon be repressed by a weaker job market and diminishing savings).&nbsp;
As the economic context becomes increasingly clear, how are equity investors responding? Well, to a first approximation, they are responding by buying growth stocks:
As has been the case for the whole of this cycle, rates are part of the growth stock story. Growth started to outperform seriously in the early weeks of March, after the trouble started at the regional banks — and when the 10-year Treasury yield fell from 4ish to 3.5ish per cent, where it has stayed ever since.
This is not, however, a pure rates story. It makes a lot of sense to avoid value stocks in a downturn, too. Stocks with low valuations tend to have more cyclical business models, more debt and more vulnerable business models than high-valuation growth stocks. They tend to do well in economic recoveries and poorly in slowdowns and recessions.
So maybe what we are seeing is more a move away from value than a move towards growth. In any case, the result is a very unbalanced market, at least in terms of S&amp;P 500 sector performance. Almost all the positive returns are coming from the growthy/techy sectors of communications, information technology, and consumer discretionary (remember that the consumer discretionary is weighted heavily to Amazon and Tesla).&nbsp;
As Robin Wigglesworth pointed out on Alphaville last week, AI-related tech stocks are doing much of the heavy lifting. He cites SocGen research finding that, if not for the AI trade, the S&amp;P 500 would be down 2 per cent this year, rather than up 8 per cent.
High quality stocks are also supposed to outperform in a downturn (“Quality” generally refers to companies with high barriers to entry, and high return on equity as a result; low leverage and low earnings volatility are often factors as well). But because growth and quality stock screens pick out a lot of the same stocks, it is sometimes hard to make sense of what’s going on. I divided the S&amp;P into quintiles by year-to-date stock performance and then looking at various growth and profitability metrics within the quintiles. While the top two quintiles had higher returns on equity than the bottom three, the signal that came through most clearly was outperformance by stocks with high valuations and fast recent growth:
It is particularly interesting, as Todd Sohn of Strategas pointed out last week, that the sector generally considered to be the most defensive, consumer staples, has only performed modestly well recently. In a downturn, staples companies’ stable profits should be attractive. Sohn offers a possible explanation. There are only three S&amp;P 500 staples stocks that offer dividend yields higher than the 5.22 per cent available on a three-month Treasury (they are Altria, Walgreens Boots, and Phillip Morris). The appeal of defensive stocks is diminished when you have a short-term risk-free asset offer a positive real return.
In the entire S&amp;P, I counted 38 stocks with dividend yields above the 3-month T-bill yield. Eleven of them are regional banks, eight are energy stocks, four are real estate investment trusts. Basically all of the 38 are highly leveraged or highly cyclical. None of them look, on first blush, like stocks to own in a downturn.
All of this raises the question: what is a defensive stock today, when the role of reliable real return is played by T-bills or other cash-like products? Might it look a little like a growth stock?
The best bet on the debt ceiling is the boring one. Though both sides have reason to do some brinkmanship, neither wants a default. So a last-minute deal will probably be clinched, as has happened before. Most markets are not pricing much, if any, debt-ceiling risk.
Some are, though. One-year credit default swap spreads are at an all-time high, and one-month bills are trading at yields 40bp above prevailing short-term rates. The chance of miscalculation is high enough, and catastrophic market impact big enough, for investors to care about a technical default. But figuring out what might happen in markets should the debt limit be breached is very tricky. Branching decisions and unknown quantities make it in effect guesswork.
We talked last week to a few FX specialists about what a technical default would mean for the US dollar. Most but not all of them expected a dollar-strengthening flight to safety. This made sense to us. And yet a recent JPMorgan survey of 123 of its institutional clients found over 70 per cent expect a technical default to weaken the dollar versus the yen, Swiss franc and euro.
What about Treasuries? JPMorgan’s fixed income strategists think short and long yields will fall as the X-date (when the government runs out of cash) approaches, noting that on average 10-year yields declined around 30bp around past debt ceiling near-misses in 2011 and 2013. Our regular correspondent Ed Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle adds that a bet on lower yields could work well if authorities intervene to keep markets running, probably with some kind of mini quantitative easing programme. But he cautions: “The starting level of rate vol is too elevated for a strong directional bet”.
However, if a technical default results in US sovereign-credit downgrades, higher yields would probably follow, argues Stephen Pavlick of Renaissance Macro. He points out that investment funds with AAA-credit quality investment mandates could be forced to divest from Treasuries, structurally lowering demand. How likely is a credit downgrade? Morgan Stanley’s public policy team explains (remember that S&amp;P downgraded US debt back in 2011):
Both Fitch and Moody’s have recently commented that if they see the probability of a default increase materially into the X-date, they would likely move their AAA ratings to negative watch or outlook. Indeed, Moody’s moved to negative watch in July 2011 around three weeks before the X-date, and Fitch did so in October 2013 two days before the X-date. While neither ended up downgrading and instead eventually removed the negative watch, it shows it’s a possible outcome again.
After a default, rules are clearer on what happens: Initially, moving beyond the X-date would likely see a much higher likelihood of rating agencies moving their ratings to negative watch, if they have not done so already. However, actual rating downgrades would likely only come after an actual missed payment in which the rules are clearer.
For bills, the shortest-term Treasuries, the main question is how the Treasury Department would juggle its obligations in a technical default scenario. It could resort to “prioritisation”, paying off debt instruments with money meant for other programmes, like Medicare or the military. This, writes Morgan Stanley’s Efrain Tejeda, could deliver some, but not total, relief to the bill market, simply because Treasury could still run out of cash to pay off bills.
This is slippery stuff to write about, let alone trade. Sitting it out might be the best move. Judging by where bill yields are, some investors already plan to. (Ethan Wu)

G7 and EU to ban restart of Russian gas pipelines,War in Ukraine,"The G7 and EU will ban Russian gas imports on routes where Moscow has cut supplies, according to officials involved in the negotiations, the first time pipeline gas trade has been blocked by western powers since the invasion of Ukraine.
The decision, which is to be finalised by G7 leaders at a summit in Hiroshima this week, will prevent the resumption of Russian pipeline gas exports on routes to countries such as Poland and Germany, where Moscow cut off supplies last year and triggered an energy crisis across Europe.
Western powers want to ensure that Russia does not receive a boost to its energy revenues as they attempt to raise economic pressure 15 months after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
One of the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move was “to make sure that partners don’t change their mind in a hypothetical future”.
A draft G7 statement seen by the Financial Times said that the group of leading economies would further reduce their use of Russian energy sources “including preventing the reopening of avenues previously shut down by Russia’s weaponisation of energy” at least until “there is a resolution of the conflict”.
One European official from outside the G7 said he suspected the move was also partly aimed at giving confidence to investors to back LNG infrastructure projects, both in Europe and North America, by removing the concern that there could be a quick return of cheaper Russian gas.&nbsp;
While the measures are unlikely to affect any immediate gas flows, it underscores a deep determination in Brussels to make permanent the rapid and painful pivot away from decades of reliance on Russian energy.
The ban is highly symbolic because at the start of the war the EU had avoided targeting pipeline flows given their huge dependence on Moscow’s gas. Russia went ahead and cut supplies anyway, sparking a surge in gas prices to more than 10 times their normal level.
But in recent months prices have fallen substantially as Europe successfully cut demand over winter, accelerated the roll out of renewable energy and sourced alternative supplies such as seaborne cargoes of LNG.
Moscow’s share of the European gas imports has fallen from more than 40 per cent to less than 10 per cent, and a mild winter has boosted gas storage in the EU.
Officials are confident that gas storage, which is already some 60 per cent full compared with roughly 30 per cent at the same time in 2022, will reach capacity long before the next winter arrives.
“With European gas storage unusually high for the time of year and wholesale prices inching back to what might just be considered their normal price-range, you can understand why Europe’s leaders are confident this plan will not scupper security of supply any time soon,” said Tom Marzec-Manser at energy consultancy ICIS.
“It’s important nevertheless not to become overly complacent regarding the European gas market outlook.”
Oil pipelines where Russia has cut supplies, including the northern leg of the Druzhba line that supplies refineries in Germany and Poland, could also be blocked under EU measures to prevent a resumption in flows.
The embargo is being discussed by diplomats as part of the EU’s 11th sanctions package. The commission said it would not comment on sanctions discussions or leaks.
One EU diplomat said that the proposal needed more clarification from Brussels to show how the “status quo” would change, particularly as some oil from Kazakhstan flows through Druzhba. “It has to be clear exactly how it would work,” they said.
Berlin and Warsaw, despite having an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, said that they would voluntarily end deliveries of crude through Druzhba last year although Poland continued to receive supplies until Russia cut off flows in February. German refineries stopped ordering Russian crude from the beginning of this year.
Some of Russia’s main gas conduits to Europe — the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines — were sabotaged last year and only one of their four strings remain. But other pipelines such as the Yamal line to Poland remain intact.

Let Russian gas exports fund Ukraine’s reconstruction&nbsp;/&nbsp;From Alan Riley, Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council, Washington, DC, US"
"G7 to impose fresh sanctions on Russian ships, aircraft and diamonds",War in Ukraine,"G7 countries are preparing new sanctions against Russia, covering ships, aircraft, individuals and diamonds, officials say, as they seek to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin’s war machine.
The plan to curtail imports of diamonds from Russia — which comes as G7 leaders meet in Hiroshima, Japan — targets one of Moscow’s few remaining export industries still relatively unscathed by western sanctions.
The summit of the group of leading economies is set to be dominated by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and by efforts to broaden sanctions, which have already badly hit Russia’s energy revenues.
The meeting, which starts on Friday and ends on Sunday, will seek to drive down Russia’s diamond mining revenues through a mechanism for tracking and tracing individual gemstones — which today does not exist.
The “traceability” initiative, included in a draft of the G7 joint statements seen by the Financial Times, is intended to stop Moscow bypassing sanctions by using India, which operates the world’s largest diamond-polishing industry, as a middleman.
A senior US official added that Washington would apply new sanctions to more than 300 Russian individuals, ships and aircraft.
He said that the US commerce department would also add 70 Russian groups to the “entity list”, a blacklist that in effect bars companies from exporting products with American technology to Russia.
“We are upping the economic pressure on Russia,” the official said.
That came as the British government said it was preparing new individual designations targeting an additional 86 people and companies from president Vladimir Putin’s military industrial complex as well as the energy, metals and shipping industries.
Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, will also announce plans for a unilateral ban on imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminium and nickel.
London said that it had already sanctioned state-owned diamond producer Alrosa and lifted tariffs on Russian diamonds by an additional 35 per cent.
“Today’s announcement goes further. We will legislate later this year to ban imports of Russian diamonds, and end all imports of Russian-origin copper, aluminium and nickel, building on existing bans of Russian iron and steel,” the UK government said.
The war is entering a crucial phase, with Ukraine poised for a military counteroffensive, just as some of Kyiv’s allies warn that support for its battle may be reaching a peak.
Meanwhile, the fall in Russia’s energy revenues, which slid more than 50 per cent in the first quarter of this year, has increased the importance of other sources of funding for the Kremlin’s war machine. Diamond exports generated $4bn in 2021.
The G7 has been grappling for months over how to set up a system to trace Russian diamonds in order to impose restrictions on their import.
Alrosa, already subject to western sanctions, produces an estimated 40 per cent of the world’s diamonds by volume from its mines, according to Edahn Golan, a diamond industry analyst.
The EU has been unable to agree a ban on Russian diamond imports ahead of the G7 summit. But member state officials say they are making progress on finding unanimous support among the 27 countries.
EU officials say the bloc is first focusing on securing agreement from India and other non-western countries for the G7 initiative to track and identify Russian produced diamonds.
“We are confident that we will have a [diamond-tracing] system in place . . . in the coming months,” said an EU official involved in the G7 discussions.
Another EU official said the agreement had been drawn up. “We don’t see objections any more. We have convinced others.”
Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni and Japan’s Fumio Kishida said in a joint statement after a bilateral meeting that they “affirmed to continue severe sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine”.
Japanese government officials said Tokyo also plans to roll out “powerful sanctions in line” with other G7 nations, indicating they would go along with targeting imports of diamonds."
Russia admits ‘problems’ as energy revenues drop,War in Ukraine,"Russia has admitted “problems” with oil and gas revenues that have fallen to their lowest levels in years, underscoring the impact of western restrictions on Moscow’s primary engine for funding its war in Ukraine.
Finance minister Anton Siluanov acknowledged issues during a public video conference with President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, blaming “all these discounts” in explaining why energy revenues fell more than 50 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
“Russia’s non-energy revenues are on track for growth as planned, with the potential for a small surplus by year-end, but there is a problem with energy revenues,” said Siluanov.
Russian oil has traded at a discount to global benchmarks because of a G7-led price caps on Russian oil and refined petroleum products, which were imposed in December and February, respectively.
This discount has narrowed as Russia has turned to non-western shipping, which is not covered by the cap, but remains significant enough to weigh on government coffers.
Despite the restrictions, in April Russia exported more oil than in any month since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. Almost 80 per cent of crude shipments flowed to China and India, according to the International Energy Agency.
Yet Moscow energy revenues for the first four months of 2023 plummeted to Rbs2.2tn ($27.3bn), levels not seen since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data from the finance ministry.
In response to Siluanov, Putin said the market situation remained “stable”. He added that Russia had addressed the issue of lower prices through “voluntary cuts” in oil production, in alignment with its OPEC+ partners.
However, Russia’s decision to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day, announced in February, had little immediate impact. Prices only rose in April after Opec announced unexpected further cuts.
Researchers at the Kyiv School of Economics estimate about 75 per cent of the decline in Russia’s revenues can be attributed to western sanctions, rather than market prices, based on analysis of oil sales records.
Siluanov also said Russia was spending at a faster rate than it was bringing in income in the first quarter of the year. However, he called the imbalance “temporary” and promised it would be levelled later."
Doing Business rankings shocker,World Bank,"Years ago, one-fourth of FT Alphaville was occasionally pestered by the PRs of various oil-soaked Gulf monarchies to write about their country’s stupendous advances in the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings.
We mostly politely declined and quietly rolled our eyes at the idea that it was easier to do business in, say, Russia than in Belgium, or the UAE than in Finland.
That the rankings turned out to have been manipulated by the Bank to boost the results of countries like China was about as shocking as finding out the pope is Catholic. That led to the rankings being suspended, and a new one (B-READY) is in the works.
But the broader issue is that many countries very nakedly gamed the various Doing Business inputs to make them appear better, with little tangible impact.
Supporters argued that even superficial efforts could still lead to positive changes, which is presumably why the World Bank has decided to revamp the methodology under a new name rather than aborting the whole idea.
However, a new paper just published by the Journal of Comparative Economics reckons that not only was there no link between a country’s Doing Business improvements and its economic vim — it actually had a negative effect in the short run.
Here’s the abstract, with FTAV’s emphasis:
We use the time series variation in the World Bank’s ‘‘distance to frontier’’ estimates of the ease of doing business to assess the effects of changes in this variable on real GDP per capita. The use of Vector Autoregression techniques allows us to identify shocks to the Doing Business scores that are initially uncorrelated with GDP, thus addressing an important endogeneity problem that affects the cross-sectional literature on this topic. We report a robust finding that improvements in Doing Business scores have at least a temporary negative impact on GDP and find little evidence for a positive effect in the years following these improvements.
The paper by Tamanna Adhikari and Karl Whelan (of the Central Bank of Ireland and University College Dublin respectively) comes up with two possible explanations for why Doing Business improvements was actually bad for near-term growth, one negative and one positive.
. . . One possibility is that the widespread focus in the developing world on the Doing Business indicators has perhaps had a negative effect, with those countries that have had the best improvements in their DTF scores being countries that have focused on box-ticking exercises to improve their ranking rather than substantive reforms.
Another possibility is that implementing improvements in business environment takes take time to have a positive impact — more time than the short time element in our analysis can pick up — and our findings are picking up some shorter-run disruptions that stem from reforms that ultimately have a positive effect.
The second explanation seems weak. If this was just a near-term cost of meaningful reforms you’d expect it to appear in the longer-term economic data (which can admittedly be hard to disentangle). But even the first could just be a statistical oddity.
It’s probably safer to assume that the Doing Business Rankings in practice mean little, and the new B-READY (another example of the unstoppable advance of the acronym) will be more of the same. For masochists, the World Bank finally published its new full methodology earlier this month."
How can I prove my husband is downplaying his investments?,Your Questions,"I am filing for divorce from my husband of 10 years, who owns a hedge fund. He claims his fund has no capital value and that the sole financial consideration should be the profits distributed on an annual basis. What can I do to prove he is trying to downplay his assets?
Emily Brand, partner and head of family at law firm Boodle Hatfield, says that when a court in England considers the financial arrangements of a divorce it first tries to establish where the assets, income and liabilities of the couple come from. If an asset has been generated during the marriage by the parties’ own efforts, it will be considered a marital asset and as such may be subject to the “sharing” principle.
This generally means that the asset will be shared equally unless one party has a greater need or if any “value” can be found to originate from before the couple got married. Your husband’s interest in the hedge fund appears to be a marital asset, which means it is capable of being shared.
A business asset such as a hedge fund is a complex financial animal, however, often relying on the skills of the owner, who usually — with a team — manages the fund. If the fund performs well it could receive substantial performance fees. These fees will be distributed as profit to the owners of the hedge fund, including your husband.
Hedge fund investors have traditionally been able to redeem their investments automatically if the fund manager (which I assume your husband will be) retires or leaves the business. This is on the basis that the individual fund manager is seen as necessary to the fund’s successful performance. It may be on these grounds that your husband is arguing that the business has no capital value.
Regardless of your husband’s arguments, you can apply to the court for an expert to carry out a valuation of your husband’s interest in the fund. In calculating that value, the expert may examine whether any comparable hedge funds have been sold recently and for what price, and the anticipated future profits (as well as past profits) of the fund.
If the&nbsp;court is persuaded there is a capital value, you may be entitled to a share in that and any direct investment your husband may have made during the marriage into the fund.
The income your husband generates after the divorce is not generally considered a marital asset. Therefore, your claims against your husband’s remuneration from the hedge fund could be limited to your needs only. This means that even if your husband’s income is substantial, your maintenance needs are likely to be assessed in line with the lifestyle you enjoyed during the marriage, regardless of whether this might leave your husband with a considerable surplus.
Inflation is at record highs and is expected to remain high. My husband and I are both in full-time jobs and we have two young children. I want to invest some of our disposable income into stocks and shares with a long-term investment horizon. What are the most effective types of shares in a high inflationary environment?
William Marsters, senior sales trader at investment platform Saxo UK, says inflation has proved very sticky. Central banks and governments alike are having a hard time bringing it back to target levels while balancing economic growth.
When it comes to managing investments in this environment it is important to maintain a balanced portfolio across asset classes and geographies. For example, as well as shares, you might want to consider bonds as they offer yield returns that are elevated in a high inflation environment. Diversification is always prudent portfolio protection.
With inflation expected to remain high in the near future, this makes some sectors and asset classes more attractive than others. As higher interest rates are the main tool used to combat inflation, this adversely pressures investments like property and gold. Growth stocks, often characterised by “above average” growth rates, are also in the cross hairs of inflation as higher rates decrease their future valuation relative to other opportunities.
On the other hand, we&nbsp;expect resilient performance from sectors that can pass on inflated prices to their consumers without affecting demand too much. Value sectors like materials, financials, industrials and utilities are examples where demand is price inelastic.
Aside from stocks and shares, commodities are also seen as a good inflation hedge. This is because the increased demand for goods and services which is driving inflation means prices of the commodities used to produce those goods will rise.
It is worth remembering that inflation is not the only macro event driving markets. The global economy is also managing a war in Europe, growing geopolitical tensions and a post-pandemic recovery in China. Along with high inflation, we believe these conditions may support the case for outperformance in European equities versus their US counterparts this year.
For example, Europe&nbsp;is better positioned to enjoy the tailwinds of China reopening due to closer trade relations. Also, the pandemic and the war have spurred investment in the tangible economy, in areas such as infrastructure and defence, which should provide a boost for European companies.
In this high inflation environment, value stocks, which are priced well below what their advocates consider to be their real worth, should outperform growth stocks. European indices cover more value sectors compared with the growth or tech-heavy US, which means European stocks are currently cheaper than their US peers on a price-to-earnings measure.
With this in mind, a broad exposure to European indices looks attractive. And as more investors consider diversifying away from US exposure, the valuation gap between European equities and their US peers could close.
You also mention your investment horizon — your most valuable weapon. As a long-term investor, you are able to smooth out the peaks and troughs of volatile markets. History shows that maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio over time brings exceptional returns.
